# Learning

Everyone should strive to learn something new every day. It's also a good idea
to try to learn in public, since others can benefit from what you learn. This
creates a positive feedback loop amongst others.

[Master How To Learn](https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/) seems like an
interesting reference. I think I could get some benefit from the articles there.

My general goal with learning is to:

- Intake knowledge either by reading [books](books/index.md) or online articles
  that are well-sourced.
- Take a moment to understand and evaluate what I just read, taking into account
  any [cognitive biases](psychology/cognitive-bias.md) I may have
- [Distill the knowledge](writing/taking-notes.md) into a storage mechanism,
  like an [Anki](learning/anki.md) deck or this wiki.
- Look for opportunities to use the information I've taken in.
- For things such as [language](/language/index.md), consider finding Anki decks
  that others have already created to make the learning process easier.

Learning is a constant in life. There's always opportunities to learn more, to
revise what my beliefs are, and to grow as a person. The goal is not to be
right; that's impossible. Instead my goal is to be less wrong over time and be
able to do something important and worthwhile with the knowledge I gain. As
such, information in this wiki [changes over time](writing/evergreen-notes.md).

## TIL Repos

TIL (Today I Learned) repos are repositories that people contribute to at least
daily of something they learned that day.

Some examples:

- [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)
- [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)
