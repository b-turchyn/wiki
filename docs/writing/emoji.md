# Emoji

- [Unicode.org's full emoji list](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)

The more I use them, the more I feel that emoji have a vital place in our
written communication. While they can be fun, emoji are capable of making the
tone of someone's writing clear rather than it being unclear or prone to
misinterpretation.

Of course, there's also a challenge of ensuring everyone interprets emoji the
same. This isn't a solved problem, but it is a step in the right direction.
