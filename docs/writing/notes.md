# Notes

A note is a unit of knowledge, captured and stored outside of your head. It can
be text, images, or quotes. 

Notes come from a source and, and that information has been synthesized by its
consumer. 

A note exists and _has value_ on its own. It can and should be combined and
linked to other notes to create something more over time.
