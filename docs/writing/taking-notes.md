# Taking Notes

## Benefits Of Hand-Written Notes

Notetaking helps you retain information. The act of writing notes helps cement
that information in your brain, but also gives you a reference to refer back to.
[Evergreen Notes](/writing/evergreen-notes.md) help enforce that by going back
to a topic and adding or modifying the note that you previously wrote.

Writing using pen and paper seems to be better in terms of recalling the
information in the future. A 2014 study[^1] seems to suggest that it's because
those who type their notes simply record information as it was presented to
them, whereas those who write out their notes by hand are reprocessing that
information and therefore have to think about what they're writing more. 

It seems like content retention for writing depends on the content that was
being written. While there was no difference when writing notes on factual
information, conceptual information had a significant difference, favouring
writing notes.

This article however seems to have flaws in it according to a correction[^2] that
was published on the topic in 2018, however the outcome does not seem to have
been impacted.

A direct replication[^3] of the original study in 2021 seems to suggest that
there's no direct correlation between note-taking format ind performance on a
quiz. (Another piece of evidence of the [replication
crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)?)

## Actually Taking Notes

The key takeaways are:
- Bulletpoint lists are simple to work with and helps provide context
  - You can infinitely nest lists as required (although this shouldn't be
    required)
- Put a title on each note. If it's date-specific, use the ISO8601 date format
- Don't be afraid to refine notes later. Written notes are great but not
  searchable. Consider loading into a wiki or [digital
  garden](/writing/digital-garden.md) for more permanent storage.
