# Zettelkasten

A Zettelkasten essentially translates to _Slip Box_.

Essentially, the logic is as follows:

- Information goes into your Zettelkasten
- Interlink as much as possible
- Avoid quotes; write in your own words

I found [this website](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) to have a
comprehensive introduction to the topic.

The Zettelkasten was something I wanted this wiki to be like, but I opted for a
more tree-like approach instead. I keep a separate Zettelkasten for rough notes
and piecing ideas together.
