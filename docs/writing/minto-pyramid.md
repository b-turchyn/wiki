# Minto Pyramid

A Minto Pyramid is a way to effectively communicate an idea in the most
efficient way possible.

## Using a Minto Pyramid

To successfully use the Minto Pyramid, communicate your ideas in the following
order:
1. Conclusion first. Lead with the punchline. Those reading what you've written
   should not have to wait until the end to understand what you want.
2. Provide the key points. You have reasons for your conclusion; back up each of
   them with specific reasons behind your statement.
3. Back up your key points with detailed information. Stating each of your key
   points on their own likely isn't enough to be able to justify each of them.
   Provide facts and references to support your claims.
