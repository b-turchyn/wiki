# Evergreen Notes

Evergreen notes are notes that evolve and accumulate over time. They should be
actively contributed to, not written once and forgotten about.

Evergreen Notes are similar in concept to articles in a
[zettelkasten](writing/zettelkasten.md). The phrase may have been coined by Andy
Matuschak[^1].
