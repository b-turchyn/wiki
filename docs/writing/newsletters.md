## Why Start A Newsletter

Creating a newsletter is an easy way to get into being a creator.

1. The barrier of entry is very low. It's possible to get started for free with
   free [software](#software) offerings.
2. It's low friction. All it takes is sitting down, writing something, and
   sending it out.
3. It's private in the sense that you're not broadcasting your face or doxxing
   yourself. You're also not beholden to a platform like YouTube or Instagram,
   where you don't own the audience.
4. Writing underpins many other forms of creativity.
5. It can potentially be a source of income in the future, in the form of
   affiliate links or sponsorship sections.

- Obligatory: focusing on this being a source of income up front (i.e. an
  external goal) [is a bad idea](productivity/goals.md).

## Topics To Write About

Roughly speaking, you can write about whatever you want. If it's content you
enjoy creating, then you're more likely to retain the discipline to continue to
contribute to your newsletter in the future. Consistency is important for
growth.

Another option is curation: taking particularly interesting content you've found
online and sharing it with your subscribers.

## Software

- ConvertKit (free for first 1,000 subscribers, paid after that)
- Ghost (either self-hosted or the cloud offering)
- Substack

Revue was a newsletter platform owned by [Twitter](social-media/twitter.md), but
was shut down on January 18, 2023.
