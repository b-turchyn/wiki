# Stock and Flow

The concept of Stock and Flow is an economic concept. It was adapted for media by writer [[Robin Sloan]]. First introduced to me in March of 2022 during the [[2022 Reading Challenge]] while reading [[Show Your Work!]].

## Flow

- Flow is the daily updates
- The reminder to the world that you exist
- Akin to a public notebook, social media is where you think publicly about topics

## Stock

- Stock is how people discover you; it is _discoverable content_
- It is _durable_. It lasts for months or years.
  - See: [my article on
    Traefik](https://brianturchyn.net/traefik-forwardauth-support-with-keycloak/) and ForwardAuth configuration.
- By writing more flow, you discover patterns in your writing
- Stock = collected, organized, and/or expanded-upon Flow
