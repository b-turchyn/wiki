# Commonplace Book

A commonplace book is a notebook that people would carry around with them to
record knowledge. That knowledge was then reread over time and rearranged for
the curator to help make sense of things, and find patterns and similarities. 

The commonplace book was popularized during the Industrial Revolution of the
18th and 19th centuries.
