# PARA Method

- PARA is a method for organizing digital information
  - Does this make sense to apply to a
    [digital garden](writing/digital-garden.md)?
- Defined by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/)
- _PARA_ stands for **P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**esources, **A**rchives

## Projects

Projects cover anything with a deadline. Completing a new feature, publishing
some content, purchasing a vehicle. These are short-term outcomes you're
actively working on. There is a _start and end_; in other words, there is a
_defined objective_ to complete. "Build garage" is an example. "Home
maintenance" is not.

## Areas of Responsibility

Something to be maintained over time. Health and fitness, professional
development, online presence. These are long-term commitments: ongoing, with no
end date and no objective to complete.

## Resources

A topic or theme of interest. How to take notes, gardening notes, recipes. It is
a _reference_. A [digital garden](writing/digital-garden.md) can embody a lot of
what is covered in resources, but typically your resources in PARA are private
and for yourself and a digital garden is generally public. I feel like the two
can coexist.

## Archives

Items from the above three categories that are completed, inactive,
unmaintained, are no longer committed to.
