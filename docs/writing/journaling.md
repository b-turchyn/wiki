## Tips

Sourced from the Daily Stoic Podcast, March 20 2022 (7 Ways Marcus Aurelius Will Help You Journal Like A Pro)
1. Prepare in the morning. Journal in the morning. Look at what today will bring and how you will respond.
2. Keep it to yourself. The content is for you and you only.
3. Repeat the most important things. This doesn't have to be original every day. Just put down what is on your mind.
4. Take it out on the page. When stressed or angry, the page is where you sort that out.

5. Copy down your favourite quotes.
6. Ask yourself tough questions. Why am I here? Why am I afraid of death? Why did I do something? 
7. Review in the evening. See what I wrote, and write about the day that passed. What could I have done better?
