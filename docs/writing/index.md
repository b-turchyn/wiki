Some techniques for writing:
- From [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/1s):
  - Write one sentence per line (don't publish this way, but edit this way;
    combine the sentences together into paragraphs during the last step of the
    editing process)
  - Strip out filler content. "Whether or not", "I think", etc.
