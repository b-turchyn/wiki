- [Just Write](https://robert.bearblog.dev/just-write/), Robert Birming
- [Five Hundred Words](https://www.fivehundredwordsaday.com/), a site for using
  the "don't break the chain" habit approach to encourage you to write 500 words
  every day.
  - I found this on Hacker News, although I forgot to record the comments link
- [Writing by hand](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/23/why-writing-by-hand-is-still-the-best-way-to-retain-information/)
  seems to be one of the best ways to [retain information](learning/index.md).

Some techniques for writing:

- From [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/1s):
  - Write one sentence per line (don't publish this way, but edit this way;
    combine the sentences together into paragraphs during the last step of the
    editing process)
  - Strip out filler content. "Whether or not", "I think", etc.
