# Writing Styles

## Starting Off

- Classism encourages us to write poetically like how old philosophers or
  playwrights used to
  - See: the quotes that are in The Daily Stoic
- Start simple
- Focus on writing clearly: the _fundamentals_ first
  - When [editing](#Editing), don't use 50 words when 10 will do

## Clear Writing

- Use short sentences. Don't use 30 words when 10 will do. Your aim is to be
  clear and concise.
- Avoid common phrases. Substitute "due to the fact that" with "because". These
  are filler words.
- Use data over adjectives (see: being clear). "We saw a significant increase"
  should be swapped out with "We saw a 15% increase".
- Don't use weasel words. Instead of "nearly half", say exactly what percentage.
- Make sure your writing has purpose. If your writing doesn't answer the
  question "so what?", then you need to rewrite.
- Be objective. Replace feelings with facts.
- Avoid acronyms and jargon. These fillers gatekeep the information you want to
  convey.
