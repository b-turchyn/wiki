# Writing Styles

## Starting Off

- Classism encourages us to write poetically like how old philosophers or playwrights used to
  - See: the quotes that are in The Daily Stoic
- Start simple
- Focus on writing clearly: the _fundamentals_ first
  - When [editing](#Editing), don't use 50 words when 10 will do
