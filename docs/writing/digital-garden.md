# Digital Garden

> A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection
> of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their
> publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ posts are linked through
> contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be
> published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
> They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal
> "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web.

## Software

- [Emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote)
- [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) - A
  Jekyll theme for creating a digital garden.
  - There's some things I like about this, namely the backlinks support. I
    wonder if I can put this functionality into Docusaurus.
- [mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden),
  a library to create a digital garden, sourcing content from Roam Research.
  - This has support for generating a graph of backlinks; I'd love to add that
    into my garden at one point. Not sure how complicated that would be.

## Communities
