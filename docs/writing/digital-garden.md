# Digital Garden

> A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection
> of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their
> publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ posts are linked through
> contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be
> published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're
> less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're
> used to encountering on the web.
