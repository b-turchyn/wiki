# Quality

Three levels of quality:
- Technical quality. Is it built to spec? Are the tolerances good?
- Luxury quality. Is it highly desired? Is it expensive?
- Creative magic quality.

Ideally you want to create content that is valuable to your readers. Content is
valuable if it is:
* Entertaining
* Inspiring
* Educational

## Distribution

Good content becomes great when it has an effective distribution mechanism.
Social media is one way to effectively distribute if you have the audience.
Ideally you create content so good that, once discovered, others will do the
sharing for you.

Permanent content such as a blog or how-to guides will continue to be
distributed over time, provided that their content is still relevant. Keep
content relevant.
