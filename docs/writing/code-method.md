# CODE Method

The CODE Method is a four-step process for capturing information in a
[Second Brain](writing/second-brain.md) or other Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) system.

The steps are:

- Capture. You can't capture everything, so touch on only what resonates with
  you. This is a gut feeling; don't overthink it.
- Organize. Digital notes can be reorganized as needed. An option is to organize
  to help you move a project forward.
- Distill. Get to the point (see: [Minto Pyramid](/writing/minto-pyramid.md)).
  Have the first line of a note be the distilled summary so you can easily refer
  back later.
  - Remember: you're not a note-taker, you're a note-giver.
- Express. Your PKM system should help you create. If you don't use what you've
  collected, it doesn't have value (at least not yet). What you create with your
  knowledge should be tailored to what you excel at.
