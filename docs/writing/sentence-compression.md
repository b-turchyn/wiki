# Sentence Compression

Some general notes:

- Avoid needless words. Keep your words potent.
- Start by writing longer sentences; get the details of what you want to talk
  about on the page first. During the editing process, trim as much fat as you
  can. Remove weasel words. Don't use ten words when five will do.
