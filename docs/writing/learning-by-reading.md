# Learning by Reading

## Levels of Learning

1. Passively reading
2. Highlighting as you go. We don't retain what we highlight. 
3. Creating a system to review your highlights.
4. Pulling in your highlights into an automated note taking system (such as Notion).
5. Taking quick notes on the books you read (book summary, impressions, impact on me, quotes from the book)
6. Summarize and take notes on the book contents. Create notes on the parts of the book that resonate with you. 
7. Putting the book knowledge you've collected into a [zettelkasten](writing/zettelkasten.md).
