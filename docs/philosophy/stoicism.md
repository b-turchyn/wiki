# Stoicism

Stoicism was first introduced to me by reading Ryan Holiday's books.

Some general notes about Stoicism and Ryan Holiday's writings:

- There are four cardinal virtues for a Stoic: Courage, Temperance, Justice
  Wisdom
- Wanting more than you have is asking for disappointment. You cannot control
  what you have or don't have, for the most part. While you can control your
  thoughts and how you perceive situations (with practice), you can't control
  whether you have something physical. Your things are not your own. They could
  all be taken from you tomorrow. Appreciate what you have, don't take it for
  granted, but accept that you may not have any of it tomorrow.
