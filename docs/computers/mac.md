# Mac OS X

A list of what I install on new machines:

- Desktop Applications:
  - [Anki](learning/anki.md) - a spaced-repetition flashcard app available on
    Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS
  - [soffes/Countdown](https://github.com/soffes/Countdown) - A countdown
    screensaver
  - [Discord](/technology/discord.md)
  - Firefox
  - Magnet - Better window snapping
  - Obsidian - for writing personal [notes](writing/notes.md) in my
    [zettelkasten](/writing/zettelkasten.md)
  - RescueTime
  - Signal
  - Spotify
  - [Todoist](/productivity/todoist.md)
  - WhatPulse
  - A [screen keep-awake](/computers/keep-screen-awake.md) application like
    Amphetamine.
- Development Tools:
  - Xcode
  - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  - [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) -
    [Node](programming/languages/node.md) Version Manager
  - [rvm](https://rvm.io) - [Ruby](/programming/languages/ruby.md) Version
    Manager
  - [My dotfiles](https://github.com/b-turchyn/dotfiles)
  - [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - Terminal
  - [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/7GMRLL) (Referral link) - Terminal I've
    been following Warp's development for a while. It looks really interesting
    and overall I'm enjoying it. iTerm2 definitely has some benefits still like
    direct integration with [Tmux](devops/tmux.md), but I think Warp has a lot
    of potential.

## Display Scaling Issues

A common issue people seem to have with external monitors is getting display
scaling to work correctly. The external display seems to end up looking
pixelated.

Some potential solutions for this:

- [bbhardin/A-Guide-to-MacOS-Scaled-Resolutions](https://github.com/bbhardin/A-Guide-to-MacOS-Scaled-Resolutions):
  A guide explaining some of the internals and some workarounds available.
- [avibrazil/RDM](https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM): I assume RDM stands for
  "Retina Display Manager". Lets you set your display to unsupported
  resolutions, helping you achieve the pixel density you actually want.
- [waydabber/BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay): A much
  more full-featured alternative to RDM. This has a ton of features around
  XDR/HDR brightness upscaling, dummy displays, DDC controls, and more. Much of
  it seems to be behind a paywall, but as of writing the price is only $15 USD.
