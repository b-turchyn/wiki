# Keeping Your Screen Awake

I have used the following programs to keep my screen awake on my computer.

For [Mac OS](/computers/mac.md):

- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704). This
  replaced Caffeine for me as my de facto keep-awake utility. This will do the
  simple "keep on" that you may need. Also supports time-based sessions, keeping
  the screen awake when certain programs are active, and various other
  [triggers](https://iffy.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000078455-getting-started-with-triggers).
  I have not experimented enough with triggers to have an opinion on them yet,
  but they look very powerful.
- I used to use [Caffeine](https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine).
  This is a simpler version of Amphetamine. Works great. This specific version
  isn't available in the App Store, but there is one there with the same name (I
  haven't used that one).
