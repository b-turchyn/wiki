# Learning List

A semi-prioritized list of things I want to learn about.

- Gearing mechanisms. Saw [this video with
  LEGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1-YeqGynlw) with various mechanical
  principles like a Schmidt Coupling which seems really cool.
- [Flutter](/programming/frameworks/flutter.md). This is really the mobile
  framework I'm most interested in, and rather than trying to pick up bits and
  pieces here and there, I need to do a proper deep-dive on it.
- React Native. I've worked with [Flutter](/programming/frameworks/flutter.md)
  but it'd be neat to see the pros and cons to another mobile framework.
- [Dermatomyositis.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatomyositis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353188)
- [JavaScript](/programming/languages/javascript.md) modules. What's the
  difference between ESM, CommonJS, and UMD? Are there other types of modules?
  What is a module, anyway?
- Financial reports, particularly ones issued by
  [charities](/philanthropy/charity.md). How do I read these? How can I see that
  my donation is getting put to good use?
