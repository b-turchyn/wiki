# Learning List

A semi-prioritized list of things I want to learn about.

- Gearing mechanisms. Saw
  [this video with LEGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1-YeqGynlw) with
  various mechanical principles like a Schmidt Coupling which seems really cool.
- [Flutter](/programming/frameworks/flutter.md). This is really the mobile
  framework I'm most interested in, and rather than trying to pick up bits and
  pieces here and there, I need to do a proper deep-dive on it.
- React Native. I've worked with [Flutter](/programming/frameworks/flutter.md)
  but it'd be neat to see the pros and cons to another mobile framework.
- [Dermatomyositis.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatomyositis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353188)
- Financial reports, particularly ones issued by
  [charities](/philanthropy/charity.md). How do I read these? How can I see that
  my donation is getting put to good use?
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs). I need to know how to properly draw these. There
  are specific symbols used to indicate certain things. This is important for
  [threat modeling](security/threat-modeling/index.md)
- unique_ptr/shared_ptr/weak_ptr

## Completed

- [JavaScript Modules](/programming/languages/javascript/modules.md). What's the
  difference between ESM, CommonJS, and UMD? Are there other types of modules?
  What is a module, anyway?
