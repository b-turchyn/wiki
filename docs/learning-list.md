# Learning List

A semi-prioritized list of things I want to learn about.

- Gearing mechanisms. Saw [this video with
  LEGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1-YeqGynlw) with various mechanical
  principles like a Schmidt Coupling which seems really cool.
- React Native. I've worked with [Flutter](/programming/flutter.md) but it'd be
  neat to see the pros and cons to another mobile framework.
- [Dermatomyositis.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatomyositis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353188)
