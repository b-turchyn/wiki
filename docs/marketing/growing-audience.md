# Growing Your Audience

A [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) blog post[^1] recommends the
following to get your first 100 followers:
1. Family
    - Your first subscribers can be by directly reaching out to your first few
      subscribers. You know them, and friends and family are more likely to want
      to support you.
2. Friends
3. Aquaintances
4. Professional Network
5. Strangers
