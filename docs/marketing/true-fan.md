# True Fans

The idea of true fans comes from [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org)[^1]'s essay
entitled "[1,000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)"; I
first became aware of the idea while reading [Tribes](books/tribes.md) by Seth
Godin.

A true fan is someone who cares deeply about you and your work, and is willing
to put in effort to support you.
