# Landing Pages

Some key areas to focus on when building a good landing page:

1. Be specific. Tell the user what your product does. It needs to be clear. If
   not, they need to waste their time reading through marketing bullshit. A new
   user should understand what your site is for quickly and clearly.
2. Explain how you make your claim happen. If you state that you are the world's
   leading platform on finding dog groomers, explain what your site does that
   makes it the best pick for your target audience.
3. Show the user how it works. Show the specifics. Don't show an artist's
   rendition of your product. Show _the product_.
4. Your copy should be written should be written like a letter to the customer.
   Without the context of a flashy landing page, what you write should still
   make sense.
   > "Donâ€™t address your readers as though they were gathered together in a
   > stadium. When people read your copy, they are alone. Pretend you are
   > writing to each of them a letter on behalf of your client."
   >
   > --David Ogilvy
5. Your content above [the fold](/design/the-fold.md) needs to be good enough so
   that you "earn" the user scrolling further down the page.
   > To earn the scroll, your above the fold must include these elements:
   >
   > - A value-focused headline
   > - A complimentary sub-headline
   > - A product photo
   > - Social Proof
   > - Next Step
   >
   > When done right, you subconsciously tell the consumer that the value
   > continues.
