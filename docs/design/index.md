# Design

- [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/): test how good of an eye you have for
  UI design
- [Visual design rules you can safely follow every
  time](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/)

  - This has some great examples, showing both bad and good for each paradigm.
    Some of these I've followed just out of habit. The "Nest Corners Properly"
    rule was one that I had never thought about before, but the moment I saw it
    in practice I realized how easy it was to actually do that in the future.

  for developers with tons of extra icons loaded into them.

Inspiration:

- [Linear](https://linear.app)([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33199304)):
  project management / issue tracking software. I love the look of [the
  dashboard](https://linear.app/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fhero%404x.15e3a396.jpg&w=3840&q=75).
  Clean look, high contrast, excellent colour scheme. There are a few areas that
  I would adjust, but that's okay.
