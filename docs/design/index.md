# Design

- [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/): test how good of an eye you have for
  UI design
- [Visual design rules you can safely follow every time](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/)
  - [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34684761)
  - This has some great examples, showing both bad and good for each paradigm.
    Some of these I've followed just out of habit. The "Nest Corners Properly"
    rule was one that I had never thought about before, but the moment I saw it
    in practice I realized how easy it was to actually do that in the future.
- [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), a collection of fonts
  for developers with tons of extra icons loaded into them.
- [Juice](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/design/juice): what it is, and how
  to use it

Inspiration:

- [Linear](https://linear.app)([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33199304)):
  project management / issue tracking software. I love the look of
  [the dashboard](https://linear.app/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fhero%404x.15e3a396.jpg&w=3840&q=75).
  Clean look, high contrast, excellent colour scheme. There are a few areas that
  I would adjust, but that's okay.
- [Task Management Platform](https://dribbble.com/shots/21145902-Task-Management-Platform)
  design by [Levi Wilson](https://dribbble.com/hilevi). The key thing for me
  here is that the most important thing (the current, in-progress task) occupies
  the most screen space. Importance is dictated by the amount of space taken.

Image placeholder libraries:

- [ThumbHash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/)
- [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/)
- An alternative option is to use a WebP file with 0% quality at a very low
  resolution, and then scaling it back up.
