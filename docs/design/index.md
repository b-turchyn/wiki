- [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/): test how good of an eye you have for
  UI design

Inspiration:

- [Linear](https://linear.app)([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33199304)):
  project management / issue tracking software. I love the look of [the
  dashboard](https://linear.app/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fhero%404x.15e3a396.jpg&w=3840&q=75).
  Clean look, high contrast, excellent colour scheme. There are a few areas that
  I would adjust, but that's okay.
