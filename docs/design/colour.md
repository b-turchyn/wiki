# Colour

## Learning

- [How to Not Suck at Color - 5 color theory tips every designer should know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rQQ_YpgcI)

## Tools

- [Colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/)
- [Huemint](https://huemint.com) - generates colour palettes using machine
  learning.
  - I love this site, but I think that's mainly because it shows you the colours
    on example sites and designs -- that's where the focus seems to be.
- [Poline](https://meodai.github.io/poline/) - "an enigmatic color palette
  generator".
  - The documentation site for this has such an interesting design. This is both
    a library and is usable via the site, but I suspect you get the most value
    out of this by using as the library. I feel like it does a great job
    demystifying how it works.
