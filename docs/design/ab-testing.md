# A/B Testing

A/B testing is when two different design options are tried for a website. Each
option is served to half of visitors. That visitor's engagement is then measured
based on the selected criteria (such as registrations, subscription purchases,
etc).

An example is using two different labels for your Call To Action button on your
[landing page](/design/landing-pages.md) to see which label drives more
registrations.

## What To A/B Test

Ideas you have with a medium amount of confidence should be A/B tested. If your
confidence is low in an idea, gather more evidence and postpone testing it. If
your confidence is very high in an idea, then just implement the idea.

## Prioritizing testing

[GoodUI](https://goodui.org) prioritizes based on three criteria:

1. Highest Expected Effect + Highest Confidence
2. Lowest Effort
3. Shortest Testing Duration

In other words: aim for maximum
