# Active Reading

The primary goal of active reading is to profit from reading -- that is, to come
out of the reading having gained an understanding of what the author is writing
about.

In general, the act of active learning requires _asking questions_, specifically
the following questions:

1. _What is the book about?_ What is the theme? What general topic is the author
   trying to convey?
2. _What is being said in detail, and how?_ What are the main ideas and
   arguments that the author makes?
3. _Are the author's claims true?_ Just because it's in a book doesn't mean that
   the author's points are valid. The contents of the book reflect the author's
   mind, but it is up to us as readers to make up our own mind.
4. _So what?_ What's so significant about what the author is saying? Why should
   we care, and why should we spend our time reading and thinking about the
   contents of this book?
