  "How to learn as much as possible about a book in a short, limited time"

# Skimming

The goal of skimming, or _pre-reading_, is to learn as much about the general
concepts of a book as possible with a limited time -- far less time than would
be required to read the book. It is the second phase of learning to read a book,
referred to as _inspectional reading_ in the book
[How To Read A Book](/books/how-to-read-a-book.md).

Steps:

1. Read the _title page_ and the _preface_ quickly. The subtitle in particular,
   if the book has one, should give you an idea about the subject of the book.
2. Study the _table of contents_. The structure of the book will be reflected in
   the table of contents, as will the key points the author will want to touch
   on (this has similar ties to [Conway's Law](/programming/conways-law.md) in
   that the book's table of contents mirrors the key points of the book).
3. Check the _index_, if the book has one. This gives you an idea on the range
   of topics that will be covered.
4. Read the _publisher's blurb_, often on the dust jacket. This is often written
   in conjunction with the author, and will contain a brief summary of the book.
5. Based on what you've learned so far, read the summary statements in the
   opening and closing paragraphs of the chapters that you believe are the most
   crucial to the book's arguments. The book [Effortless](/books/effortless.md)
   had a point-form summary of each chapter and the book up until that point at
   the end of each chapter and section, respectively.
6. Jump in and out of the book, reading a few paragraph or pages here and there.
   In addition to this, look for a summary chapter or epilogue where tho author
   will almost certainly summarize their book's main talking points.

   This approach came from [How To Read A Book](/books/how-to-read-a-book.md),
   which first came out in the 1940s; for this random jumping around, is there a
   good way to do this with eReaders and digital reading? How about audio books?
