# Effective Reading

Unless you're reading a fiction book for entertainment purposes, ideally you
should be reading effectively so that you are getting the most out of the book
and of [your time](/productivity/index.md).

Below are some notes on the ways that various people recommend reading
effectively.

Each page of book notes should contain the following sections:

1. Impressions. Write down your stream of consciousness as you read the book.
   You can talk about tone or things you find interesting. Is there something in
   the book that speaks to you, that you think you could apply to your life? Who
   should read this book? This can be written like it's a general review of the
   book, similar to what you would read in a newspaper.

   This can be 3-5 sentences.

2. Actionable takeaways. This is a step past the highlighting of passages in the
   book. For each highlight or bookmark you put down, take that one step further
   and describe how that concept can be changed into an action that can be used
   to better your life in some way.

   Elizabeth limits her actionable takeaways to at most 10 items. You can
   highlight more in your book, but the actionable takeaways should be limited
   so you can actually use the information.

3. Favourite Quotes. This is for information that should be preserved in its
   original form, either because it's beautifully worded or you think you would
   want to use this quote in the future. Again, at most 10 quotes.
4. Bonus items. For something that is so groundbreaking and requires a bit more
   explanation than the actionable takeaways above, these can be preserved here.
   A multi-step process that you believe is valuable could be put here.

The primary question Elizabeth focus on is _how this book can add something to
her life_.
