# Reading

I really enjoy reading, although the majority of my prior reading has been
around technical documentation for [programming](/programming/index.md) or [blog
posts](/writing/blogging.md) about [productivity](/productivity/index.md). I've
started to read more long-form [books](/books/index.md) starting in 2022.
