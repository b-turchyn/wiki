# Reading

I really enjoy reading, although the majority of my prior reading has been
around technical documentation for [programming](/programming/index.md) or
[blog posts](/writing/blogging.md) about [productivity](/productivity/index.md).
I've started to read more long-form [books](/books/index.md) starting in 2022.

The [stoic philosophers](philosophy/stoicism.md) believed that you should
re-read books frequently, as we grow and learn and change over time.

## Applications

Various applications, web clippers, etc.

- [Readwise](https://readwise.io/)
  - [My referral link](https://readwise.io/i/brian0927) can be used to get a
    free month for both myself and the user of the link.
  - This seems like a great service for those that have a Kindle _and purchase
    eBooks through Amazon._ Automatic highlight syncing relies on Amazon having
    your highlights, and Amazon only syncs highlights from your eReader if you
    purchased the eBook through them.
- [Clippings](https://clippings.io/), a site for working with Kindle clippings
  - Has a free and paid offering; the free offering does not support exporting,
    so you effectively need to pay to get your data out of the system.
- [Reading Notes](http://reading-notes.com/), a Kindle clipping manager.
  - Free and open source with
    [code hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/mammuth/kindle-clippings)
  - Seems like a good, but lesser-featured app. I don't see tagging support, and
    the export functionality and API are still on the roadmap.
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), a place to collect items to read
  later.
  - Has both a free and paid option. Premium gives you access to full-text
    searching of everything you upload, and unlimited notes rather than the
    current limit of 5 notes per month.
- [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/), a read-it-later app, similar to Instapaper
  - Free and open source with
    [code hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag).
  - I use this for storing articles. Overall it works pretty well. The Android
    app doesn't look very nice, but it works just fine and that's what matters.
  - Someone has created a
    [native Kindle app](https://github.com/cekage/wallindle) for Wallabag, but
    it requires a jailbroken Kindle.
