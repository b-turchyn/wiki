# Royalty-Free Music

A collection of music collections that can be used in
[Twitch streams](social-media/streaming.md), YouTube videos, and more for
commercial purposes without paying any royalty fees.

- [Backing Track](https://backingtrack.gg/)
  - I heard about Backing Track through Youtuber and Twitch streamer
    [EposVox](http://www.eposvox.com/)
- [ImKibitz](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Fpsbg72bzVJ6cUXIjBGVI?si=8b0632a3ea8d4074)
  - Kibitz has one playlist that explicitly said that it's copyright-free. Not
    sure about other playlists.
- [Soundtrack by Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/soundtrack)
  - Should be safe for streaming on Twitch. Not sure about other platforms.
  - This is probably the worst available option. This is because you need to
    have Soundtrack writing to a separate audio track so they can be removed
    from VODs, so this doesn't really constitute royalty-free. (Not surprising
    for Twitch).
- [Stream Beats](https://www.senpai.tv/streambeats/) by Harris Heller
  - I first heard about this through Harris Heller's YouTube videos
- [LoFi Girl](https://lofigirl.com/use-the-music/)
  - Credit is required in the descriptions; see the above link for how to credit properly.
