# VSTs

VST stands for
[Visual Studio Technology"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology).
It can be used with a host application such as a DAW.

## VST Hosts

- [Light Host](https://github.com/rolandoislas/LightHost/) has been around for a
  long time, but has not been updated since 2016. Works fine enough, but is a
  bit difficult to use and you can't have more than one of the same VST running
  in the same chain. Works nicely with Voicemeeter.
- [Pedalboard 2](http://www.niallmoody.com/work/pedalboard2/), available on both
  Windows and [MacOS](computers/mac.md). Currently using this on my Windows
  machine.
