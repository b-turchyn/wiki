# 30 Day Challenges

I first got the idea for 30 day challenges from [Matt
D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/@mattdavella) and his many videos doing this.

An ideal 30 day challenge for myself is one that:

1. Pushes myself out of my comfort zone;
2. Gets me to try something new; or
3. Removes something from my life that I know isn't positively contributing; or
4. Encourages me to do more of something that I know will positively contribute.

This ties into the concept of a yearly (or seasonal)
[theme](/self-improvement/themes.md), but with more defined goals and a shorter
timespan.  I think of this as a _targeted focus_ on _one thing_ that ties into your
theme.
