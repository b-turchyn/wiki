# Themes

A theme is a looser version of a New Year's resolution. I first learned about
the idea of a theme from [CGP Grey's theme video](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE).

The general process is:

- Find a word or short phrase that _resonates with you_. Describe your theme as
    the "Year of X" or the "Season of Y".
- Consider this theme every time you make a decision.

## Examples

If your theme is "The Season of Health", consider:
- Biking or walking to the grocery store rather than driving
- When walking your dog, walk one more block than you normally would
- Avoid buying the unhealthy snack and instead get a healthier one
- Do five push-ups in between meetings at work

If your theme is "The Year of Novelty", consider:
- Buying a different snack at the grocery store than you typically would
- Take a different route to/from work
- Travel somewhere for vacation rather than staying home
- Grab drinks with a friend on a whim
