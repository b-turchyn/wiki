# 3D Printing

Models I want to try:

- [Moidules](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:681835) for creating
  arbitrarily-sized shelves. I wonder how strong these are with a material like
  ASA.
- [Rod holder / wall mount for 24mm and 28mm rods](https://www.printables.com/model/1011593-rod-holder-wall-mount-for-24mm-28mm-filament-rod)
- [A portable ATX power supply](https://www.printables.com/model/1027886-portable-atx-psu)
- The [LowRider 4 CNC](https://www.printables.com/model/1034840-lowrider-4-cnc)
  when I have room for it.

## Gridfinity

My favourite storage system. I use this in most of my drawers for grouping
things together.

- [Gridfinity Master Collection](https://www.printables.com/model/242711-gridfinity-master-collection),
  collected by GlitchPrinter
- [Storage Box (parametric)](https://www.printables.com/model/543553-gridfinity-storage-box-by-pred-now-parametric)
  for transporting boxes around
- [Storage Box Shelves](https://www.printables.com/model/1023055-gridfinity-storage-box-shelves-parametric).
  Parametric, so they can be sized based on how big you made the case.

Web-based generators:

## Multiboard

Multiboard seems like a successor to the Honeycomb Storage Wall and has some
adapters.
