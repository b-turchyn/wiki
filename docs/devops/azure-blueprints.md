# Azure Blueprints

Azure Blueprints allow you to apply templates of role assignments, policy
assignments, Azure Resource Manager templates, and resource groups to a
subscription.

The general goal is to be able to apply settings once in a predictable fashion
and have them apply elsewhere. For example, there is a standard ISO 27001
template built into Azure that can be applied.
