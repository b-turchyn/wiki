# Zero Trust Architecture

> Never trust, always verify

The general concept of a Zero Trust architecture is that you never trust
anything within that network, even on a trusted, internal network. Each side of
a communication chain should perform mutual authentication to ensure that both
sides trust each other, and assume the connection between the systems can also
not be trusted.

Zero Trust products:

- [zrok](https://zrok.io/)
  - I first saw this on Hacker News. Looks neat, but haven't used it yet.
- [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/)
  - I've used this in my internal network before. Took a while for me to set up,
    but I had never worked with a Zero Trust network before, so part of that was
    probably my lack of understanding of it.
