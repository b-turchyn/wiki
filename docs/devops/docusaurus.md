# Docusarus

Docusarus is the engine that generates this wiki. I picked this system based on
its use by [Nikita Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) in their
[knowledgebase](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/).

## Folder Categorization

Categories can be customized by creating a `_category_.json` in a
directory[^1].

## Automatic Deployments to Github Pages

Docusaurus has automatic build and deploy wrapped into a single command:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This works great for local deploys, but requires some additional commands to
work with [Github Actions](/devops/github-actions).

The current build and deploy action can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/b-turchyn/wiki/blob/main/.github/workflows/node.js.yml),
but in short, the approach is:
* Check out the code
* `npm ci`
* Configure git credentials
* Run `npm run deploy`
* Cleanup (done automatically)

## Custom Javascript Loading

Custom Javascript is loaded via `docusaurus.config.js` in the `scripts`
section[^2]:

```typescript
const config = {
  scripts: [
    // String style
    'my-js-host.example.com/my.js',
    // Object style
    {
      src: 'my-js-host.example.com/my.js',
      defer: true
    }
  ]
}
```
