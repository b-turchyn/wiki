# Management Group

A managament group manages access, policies, and compliance across multiple
Azure subscriptions.

Management groups sit above subscriptions. An organization may have multiple
Azure subscriptions based on their needs, and a management group can impose
requirements and restrictions across all of those from one central location. A
common way to do this is through [Azure Blueprints](devops/azure-blueprints.md).
