# Value Stream Maps

A VSM helps analyze the current release cycle process. The goal is to visually
show where a team creates value and where there's waste. Armed with this
information, a team should aim to create a process that delivers maximum value
with minimum waste.

Some values to consider:

- _Process time_ is how long the team spends on tasks that _provide value_.
- _Total lead time_ is how long it takes the team to get that feature to the
  customer.
- _Activity_ ratio is the ratio between the process time and the total lead
  time:
  $$
  Activity Ratio = \frac{Process Time}{ Total Lead Time }
  $$
