# Blocklists

- [blocklistproject/Lists](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists): A bunch
  of lists targeting specific categories of sites to block
  - I am currently using the Abuse and Smart TV lists
- [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts): The "gold standard"
  for a standardized blocklist
- [b-turchyn/blocklists](https://github.com/b-turchyn/blocklists): My own maintained list of things I don't want to see. Contains uBlock Origin element blocks for search results, filtering out copycat websites.
