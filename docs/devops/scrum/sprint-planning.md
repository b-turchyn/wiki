# Sprint Planning

- [ ] Team member capacity and days off established
- [ ] Upcoming distractions are predicted and factored into capacity
- [ ] The overall goal of the sprint is understood

For each work item brought into sprint:

- [ ] We know if it can/should be demo'd
- [ ] The team members working on it understand what the goal is, what's being asked, and how to test it
- [ ] The estimate is close enough and can be accomplished in sprint with the other distractions
