## Contribution Graph Generators

- [GitHub Unwrapped](https://www.githubunwrapped.com/)
  - This generates a little MP4 video that you can share and produces graphs
      for:
    - Contributions for each day of the week
    - Contributions for each hour of the day
    - Issues created (and how many are closed)
    - Pull requests created
  - Only requires a GitHub username, no login required
- [GitHub Wrapped](https://wrapped.run/)
  - No relation to GitHub Unwrapped
  - Requires you to log in with your GitHub account
- [GitHub Trends](https://www.githubtrends.io/wrapped)
  - Requires you to Star the repository before it will generate the results, but
      doesn't require you to log in
  - Lots of graphs and LOC analysis
- [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/)
  - Official GitHub project
  - Gives a 3D representation of your contributions and will provide an STL file
      to get it 3D printed
- [GitHub City](https://honzaap.github.io/GithubCity/)
  - Similar to GitHub Skyline, except more like a low-poly _Cities: Skylines_
      vibe
- [GitHub Contributions Chart Generator](https://github-contributions.vercel.app/).
  Generates an image for your entire GitHub history.
- [Grass-Graph](https://grass-graph.appspot.com/). Generates for the current
  year. Has some minor formatting issues for the text placement (as of
  2022-11-28).
