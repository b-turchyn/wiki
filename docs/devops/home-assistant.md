# Home Assistant

My favourite home automation system.

Interesting integrations:

- [rbaron/r-parasite](https://github.com/rbaron/b-parasite) - Bluetooth Low
  Energy (BLE) soil moisture and ambient temperature/humidity/light sensor.
  Claims to be able to run for over a year on a single CR2032 battery

## Troubleshooting

- Tuya integration: error 2406 skill_id invalid can be solved by removing and
  re-adding the integration within the Tuya admin panel.
