# Agile

_I wasn't sure where to put this article, so it's going under Leadership for
now. This doesn't seem like the right spot, but I can't think of a better
option. Somewhere is better than nowhere, I guess..._

- [Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)](https://less.works) is supposed to help with using
  agile development techniques with a large team. Personally, I haven't found it
  to be successful yet, but that is more likely that we aren't leveraging it
  correctly.
  - The
    [Architecture & Design](https://less.works/less/technical-excellence/architecture-design)
    information I find particularly interesting given the challenge of having
    independent teams while also having a cohesive architecture. This is one of
    my primary concerns with Agile while in a large team.
- [Agile Product Management: Do the _Right_ Things, Not Everything](https://www.slideshare.net/ellengott/agile-product-management-do-the-right-things-not-everything),
  slides. Created by [Ellen Gottesdiener](https://www.ebgconsulting.com),
  presented at Big Apple Scrum Day, May 2019
  - Slide 15 talks about the _gradient of agreement_ which I think is a useful
    concept to have on a team.
