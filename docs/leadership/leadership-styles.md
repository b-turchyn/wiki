# Leadership Styles

There are six main styles of leadership. A leadership style isn't something that
a leader picks and then stays with; instead, a leader moves fluidly between the
leadership styles depending on the situation at-hand.

## The Styles

### Coercive

> Do it, or else.

A leader tells someone what to do, and there's an expectation that it's
followed through on. Feedback is to correct an issue rather than praise someone
for doing a good job.

This is effective in crisis situations, if a team is inexperienced with simple
tasks and there's limited time to complete a task, or there's a need to put a
stop to unwanted behaviour. In virtually every other situation, this will lead
to a higher attrition. Team members _will_ quit.

This style also can't be used regularly. Overuse means that team members will
get used to this communication style and it won't be effective.

### Authoritative

> Here's the big picture. Let me convince you why we should work towards this
> together.

### Affiliative

### Democratic

> Two is better than one.

The democratic leadership style shares decisions and responsibility. Team
members are involved in most decisions, with the goal to achieve concensus
amongst all team members.

The democratic style is effective when you have a skilled, talented,
knowledgeable team. It's also useful when trying to source new ideas.

Similarly, if you don't have confidence in the team's abilities, the team lacks
the required skillsets, or are "ill-informed", then the democratic style is more
likely going to lead to failures. Crisis situations are no place for democratic
leadership; opt for the [coercive](#Coercive) or [pacesetting](#Pacesetting)
styles instead. 

Overuse of the democratic leadership style can lead team members to doubt the
ability of the leader's ability to do their job (i.e. _lead_).

### Pacesetting

> Here's how you do it.

With pacesetting, you are leading by example. High quality output is expected,
and is enforced by taking away responsibilities if someone does not perform at
the expected level.

This leadership style excels when working with team members that are smart,
highly motivated, and who want to follow best practices (provided that you're
demonstrating those best practices, of course). Obviously, this also requires
that you as the leader are capable of demonstrating those best practices.

Pacesetting can also be used when you feel that team members need to see what
the output of a high performer looks like so they know where they need to aim.

Avoid using pacesetting often. It can stifle the long-term development of your
team members because they don't get to learn on their own. It's also damaging to
team morale, since you effectively take away their agency.

### Coaching

> Let me help you grow.

With this leadership style, the leader:
- Invests time in knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each team member
- Works with each team member to help them achieve their personal development
  goals

This is a long-term investment in your team; short-term performance is likely
impacted because they'll need time to invest in their growth. That time means
that other tasks may not get completed as fast as if they worked on them
directly.

If a team member doesn't know where they want to go, needs explicit direction,
or has performance issues that need correction, this may not be effective. In
that case, consider [Pacesetting](#Pacesetting).

In crisis situations, coaching is too slow. Consider the [Coercive
style](#Coercive) instead.
