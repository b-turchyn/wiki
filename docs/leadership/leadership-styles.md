# Leadership Styles

There are six main styles of leadership. A leadership style isn't something that
a leader picks and then stays with; instead, a leader moves fluidly between the
leadership styles depending on the situation at-hand.

## The Styles

### Coercive

> Do it, or else.

A leader tells someone what to do, and there's an expectation that it's
followed through on. Feedback is to correct an issue rather than praise someone
for doing a good job.

This is effective in crisis situations, if a team is inexperienced with simple
tasks and there's limited time to complete a task, or there's a need to put a
stop to unwanted behaviour. In virtually every other situation, this will lead
to a higher attrition. Team members _will_ quit.

This style also can't be used regularly. Overuse means that team members will
get used to this communication style and it won't be effective.
