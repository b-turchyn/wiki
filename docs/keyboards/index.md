# Keyboards

Keycaps come in tons of different styles. The following sites have useful
information about them:

- [Keycap Profiles: The Ultimate
  Guide](https://teksbit.com/keycap-profiles-guide/), TEKSBIT
- [A Guide to Keycap Profiles and
  Materials](https://switchandclick.com/ultimate-guide-to-picking-a-keycap-set-for-your-mechanical-keyboard/),
  Switch and Click

Keyboards I own:

- [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix) with [KAT
  Drifter](https://thekey.company/pages/kat-drifter) keycaps and
  [C<sup>3</sup>Equalz x TKC Tangerine
  switches](https://thekey.company/products/c3-tangerine-switches-r2)
- [Drop ALT](https://drop.com/buy/drop-alt-mechanical-keyboard) low profile with
  stock keycaps and [C<sup>3</sup>Equalz x TKC Banana Split
  switches](https://thekey.company/products/banana-split-switches)
- [Drop + OLKB Preonic V3](https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard)
  with stock keycaps and Kailh Bronze switches
- [IBM Model M (1986)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard)

## Switches

Clicky switches can be made clicky by click jackets or click bars.

- Click jacket example (on Cherry Blue switches):

## QMK

I'm a big fan of [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/) on all of my keyboards for
its amazing customizability. 

- [QMK Website](https://qmk.fm)
- [A guide to home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
  ([Archive](https://archive.ph/vYS3I)), using QMK's [mod-tap
  functionality](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap)

Similar to QMK:

- [LGUG2Z/komokana](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komokana) does application-aware
  keyboard layer switching in Windows (written in Rust)
