# Typing Trainers

- [ZType - Type to Shoot](https://zty.pe)
  - This was shown to me by [a friend of
    mine](https://www.twitch.tv/nitztriplesix). This is like the games
    [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) or [Space
    Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), but to shoot the
    ships you need to type the words correctly. Tons of fun, but less focused on
    deliberately practicing your skill gaps
- [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)
  - This is my preferred typing practice site. Nice interface, lots of stats and
    graphs, and is respectful of non-QWERTY keyboard layouts.
- [Typing Practice](https://www.keybr.com/) (keybr.com)
  - I think this one has a lot of value to it for those that want to improve on
    their weakest keys or patterns. It uses your accuracy for each key to
    determine what words or patterns to provide to you to practice, so you
    should be working on what you're weakest on each time.
