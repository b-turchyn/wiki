# Eat The Frog

The phrase "eat the frog" refers to taking care of the hardest, most important
task in your day as soon as possible.

> If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning.
> And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.
>
> --Mark Twain

This technique works for getting things done for a few reasons:

- Typically your self-control is highest at the start of your day. This reduces
  the risk that your [procrastination](/productivity/procrastination.md) doesn't
  take over and cause this item to not get done.
- Once complete, it removes your day's biggest burden, reducing stress and
  giving you a win at the start of your day.

While Mark Twain's quote talks about the morning, the key point in time is at
the start of _your_ day, whenever that happens to be. Those who wake up at 2pm,
10pm, or 5am should treat "the morning" as whenever that person first wakes up.
