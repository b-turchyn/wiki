# Time Tracking

## Apps

- [Toggl Track](https://track.toggl.com)
  - I have used this for years. Their API is pretty good and is well-documented.
    I tie it into Tasker automations, scanning NFC tags around the house to
    change time entries
- [Traggo](https://traggo.net/)
  - This is a really neat concept. There are no tasks, just tagged time spans.
    This lets you do things like note how much study time you spent while
    listening to music, for example. Haven't tried it yet because I'm too tied
    into Toggl right now, but I think there's lots of potential here (although
    lots of potential complication as well)
