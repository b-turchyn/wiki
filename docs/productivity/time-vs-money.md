# Time vs Money

You can trade time for money; this is what we do when we go to work.

You _can't_ trade money for time. While there are things you can pay for to save
you some time, there is a limit to what you can buy. You can't buy more hours in
the day; we all have the same 24 hours to work with. You can however pay for
services that then allow you to use your time more valuably.

This works if:
* Someone is selling the service you want
* You can afford the amount they're charging
* You're getting _at least_ that much value out of it.

It's worth noting that "value" here is not necessarily monetary value. It can
be, but it doesn't have to be. You may value paying someone to shovel your walk
because your mental and/or physical health will be better as a result, even if
you don't get direct monetary value from that. Conversely, spending $100 on
something may allow you to invest your time to get $1,000 of value, but the
actual monetary value may not be what you're looking for.
