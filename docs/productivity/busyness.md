# Busyness

Assuming there aren't external factors at play (i.e. working multiple jobs to
make ends meet), busyness is a coping mechanism so we can avoid thinking about
our lives.

When getting things done, it's best to ensure that your time is being spent
effectively. Taking [breaks](/productivity/breaks.md) is important and should be
considered valuable, but for work-related tasks consider a time management
technique like the [Eisenhower Matrix](/productivity/eisenhower-matrix.md) for
some basic task organization.
