# To-Do Apps

Options for to-do lists:

- Pen and paper
  - It's simple, easy, virtually free, and gives you that satisfaction of
    physically checking something off of a list. Pairs nicely with bullet
    journaling.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com)
  - This is my go-to, and I've been a paying customer for years.
  - The karma system is a nice incentive for getting things done
  - There's enough depth and complexity for general life planning things without
    it being a full-blown project management tool. Tags, due dates, recurring
    tasks, nested projects, and natural language processing (NLP) for the due
    dates.
  - Great API integrations.
