# Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a time management technique, which involves scheduled periods of
work and rest. 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of rest is common, with
a longer break after 4 sets.

The effectiveness of the technique stems from the brain's inability to [focus](productivity/focus.md) for
extended periods of time.

    don't have a source of music already.
