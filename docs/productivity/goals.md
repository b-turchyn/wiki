# Goals

Goals need to be _action-based_, not _outcome-based_. The actions you take are
entirely within your control; the outcome is not.

Ali Abdaal in his newsletter post _The Spectrum of Control_ that there are three
levels of goals, each with varying amounts of control that you have in their
success:

1. Input Goals. Goals that are specifically based on how much you put into
   something. For example:
   - Spend 30 minutes reading every day
   - Go to the gym 4 times a week
2. Output Goals. These are about measurable results. For example:
   - Writing a certain number of words each day
   - Hitting your step count
3. Outcome Goals. This is usually what people actually want. For example:
   - Getting a million followers on Twitter
   - Being famous
   - Creating that beach body

As you work down that list, the amount of direct control you have over that type
of goal significantly drops. In general, avoid Outcome Goals in favour of Output
Goals, and avoid Output Goals in favour of Input Goals. The more control you
have over a goal, the more likely you are to be able to hit that goal.
