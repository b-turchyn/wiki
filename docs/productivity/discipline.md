# Discipline

[Motivation](/productivity/motivation.md) comes and goes, but discipline
empowers you to push past a lack of motivation. Discipline comes before
motivation, not the other way around.

One way to build discipline in doing a particular task is with an _if-then_
approach. Examples include:

- _If_ I want to watch YouTube videos, _then_ I will do it while exercising
- _If_ I want to drink, _then_ I need to go for a walk around the block first

Our ability to do hard things -- to be disciplined -- is governed by the
[prefrontal cortex](/health/brain.md#prefrontal-cortex) of our brain. Kids who
did better at the Marshmallow Test also had a more developed prefrontal cortex
and were later seen to be more successful in life. (Possible
correlation-not-causality here; source needed)
