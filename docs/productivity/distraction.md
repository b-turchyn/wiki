# Distraction

Apps for distraction prevention:

- [LeechBlock NG](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) (browser extension)
  - I use this and I just completely block off a bunch of social media sites
    during my work day
- [PawBlock](https://www.pawblock.dannyguo.com/) (browser extension)
  - Shows you pictures of cats
- [Focus](https://meaningful-things.com/) by Meaningful Things (Apple devices
  only)
  - Requires a subscription
- [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) (MacOS 10.10+)
  - Free, open source

I used to use Forest but they collect a bunch of information that it doesn't
need to. I no longer use or recommend it.
