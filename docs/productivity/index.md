# Productivity

Avoid saying "yes" to everything. Saying "yes" all the time means you're not
being selective with your time; you're spreading yourself too thin. Instead,
adopt the "hell yeah, or no" approach. Say "no" to everything except the things
that truly get you excited.

If you really, truly need to get something done, say "no" to everything except
the one key focus.
