# Monkey Brain

The _Monkey Brain_ is a concept described in Jay Shetty's book _Think Like A
Monk - Train Your Mind for Peace and Purpose Every Day_.

In the [Hitopadesha](books/hitopadesha.md), the mind is described as a drunken
monkey that's been bitten by a scorpion and haunted by a ghost. If each branch
on a tree is a thought, the monkey randomly swings between the thoughts. The
_Dhammapada_ has a verse in it that reminds us that the mind needs to be shaped
and trained, just like archers crafting their arrows or irrigators leading water
where they want it to end up.

Jay describes the mind in two parts. The Monkey Brain is like a child, crying
when it doesn't get what it wants. The Monk Brain is like an adult, is able to
think long-term and rationally. The Monkey Brain can't be and shouldn't be fully
suppressed, as the Monk Brain can be too controlling, leading the Monkey Brain
to be bitter and resentful.
