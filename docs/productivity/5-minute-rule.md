# 5 Minute Rule

The 5 Minute Rule is a trick to encourage you to get working on a long task that
you don't feel motivated to do. The trick ties into humans wanting to maintain
momentum on whatever they're doing.

To use the 5 Minute Rule, commit to doing that task for only five minutes. In
the worst case, you get five minutes of work done on it. More often than not,
you will continue working on it.

The work can be a simple, small part of the workload. Instead of taking on a big
feature, find something small that you can accomplish during that time.
Completing something during that 5 minutes will also motivate you.
