# Deliberate Practice

- The most effective way to get better at something is to engage in deliberate practice
- When practicing something, work on something just outside your current abilities
- Stay actively focused on the current task. Consider using [focus](/productivity/focus.md) techniques
  such as [Pomodoro](productivity/pomodoro.md).
  - Practice time is not sufficient. Deliberate practice time is required.
  - The 10,000 Hours rule applies to deliberate practice, not coasting
- Do not multi-task. Multitasking is almost universally a bad idea and results in the belief that more work is getting done, when really less is getting done and your practice isn't deliberate.
