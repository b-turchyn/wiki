# Breaks

Breaks are critical for growing and be productive. Continuously pushing for more
without recovery time leads to [burnout](health/mental-health/burnout.md).
Breaks are also part of the stress-and-rest cycle described in the book Peak
Productivity.

Breaks should take place at various intervals to keep you healthy, productive,
and focused.

- Short breaks should be taken throughout the day,
  [Pomodoro](/productivity/pomodoro.md)-style.
- Roughly a day off per week
- A week off per quarter
