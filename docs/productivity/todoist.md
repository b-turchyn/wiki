# Todoist

[Todoist](https://todoist.com) is my preferred
[to-do app](/productivity/to-do.md). I've been a paying customer for years.

## Tips and Tricks

- If you need a task to occur multiple times per day, there are three different
  approaches:

  1. Create multiple copies of the same task.
  2. Create your recurring schedule based on a period of hours, not of specific
     times, such as `every 12 hours` or `every 8 hours` for tasks that need to
     occur twice or three times per day.
  3. For newly-created tasks, Reddit user
     [/u/ConsequenceAncient29](https://www.reddit.com/r/todoist/comments/8gxsdx/recurring_twice_daily/hz4kn4b/)
     has found that you can achieve this with the phrasing of
     `every day at 7am and every day at 9pm`. When I tried
     `every day at 7am and 9pm`, it did not work, so the `and` operator seems to
     not be aware of the earlier `every day`, which I suppose makes sense.

  I found this generally pretty flaky to get working; when I tried it once it
  seemed to work, but trying with a brand new task didn't work.

## Templates

  - This is more for the creation of a blog or personal website rather than the
    ongoing maintenance of it.
