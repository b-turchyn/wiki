# Focus

## Building Focus

1. Set a baseline. See how long you can focus without getting distracted. Time
   this.
2. For each of the following focus sessions, see if you can make it one minute
   longer each time.

It's important to remember that this is not a linear progression. There will be
ups and downs, just like any sort of training and exercise, physical or mental.
