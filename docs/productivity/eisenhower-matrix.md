# The Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is a time management technique to help you roughly
prioritize tasks into four buckets. The technique is usually represented in a
2x2 grid with each axis representing _urgency_ and _importance_.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th align="center">Important</th>
      <th align="center">Not Important</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th align="right">Urgent</th>
      <td align="center">Do immediately</td>
      <td align="center">Delegate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="right">Not Urgent</th>
      <td align="center">Schedule</td>
      <td align="center">Delete</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

While urgent tasks need to be done as soon as possible, urgent tasks are usually
a sign of:
- Something outside of your control (i.e. production issue)
- Poorly managed time

The goal is to spend the most time in _important, but not urgent_. This is where
the majority of fulfilling work should reside. The work is important, but you
don't have to rush because it's not urgent.

Urgent tasks that are not important to you should be delegated as much as
possible, preferably to someone who finds the work important.

If it's neither important nor urgent, don't do the work.
