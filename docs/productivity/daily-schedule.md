# Daily Schedule

A daily schedule is a key part of removing motivation from being a catalyst to
action, and instead relying on discipline and habit.

## My Daily Schedule

I have several key things I want to get done in a given day:

- Exercise
- [Journal](/writing/journaling.md)
- Read
- Eat healthy food at times that make sense for my body
- Work at my job

## Scheduling Thought Processes

A few key considerations when building your own schedule:

### Routine Is Key

By having a routine, you stop thinking about the individual tasks to be done and
just start doing the work. This reduces the number of decisions you need to make
in a given day, helping to prevent
[decision fatigue](/productivity/decision-fatigue.md).

### Identify The Priorities

Without knowing what are the most important things for you, it's impossible to
build your schedule. Define what those critical things are. Schedule those when
they make the most sense for you.

### Eat The Frog

_(See: [Eat The Frog](/productivity/eat-the-frog.md))_

There is always too much to get done in a given day. Get the most important
things done first.

### Don't Forget Your Chores

In this case, "chores" are anything that needs to get done that we may not
necessarily want to spend time on, but are critical parts of our life or
requirements for hitting a given goal.

Time spent in-transit to a location (such as riding the bus to school or work),
cleaning up around the house, and cooking all qualify as "chores". All of these
need to occur.

### Review and Revise Regularly

The first daily schedule you create will likely have problems. You may find that
[decision fatigue](/productivity/decision-fatigue.md) set in before something
challenging is scheduled and as a result you tend to skip this item. You may
also find that you scheduled too much or too little time in your day for
something.

Life changes. Your commitments today or when you create your schedule will
change over time. Revise your schedule when your life situation changes.

Take time to note what works and what doesn't. On a day-by-day basis, this can
be done when you [journal](/writing/journaling.md), and then reviewed on a
weekly or monthly basis.
