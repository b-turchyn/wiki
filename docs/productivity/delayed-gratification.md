A critical skill to develop is to be able to work on something today and not
reap the benefits for a long time. Depending on the item, that delay may be
days, months, years, or even beyond one's lifetime.

This has been represented in the psychological experiment known as the
Marshmallow Test, ultimately coming down to "do you want one marshmallow now, or
two marshmallows in 15 minutes?". Those who were able to wait demonstrated
generally stronger life skills, including higher SAT scores, being able to cope
with stress better, and a lower Body Mass Index when compared to those who caved
and ate the marshmallow early.

We demonstrate this on a regular basis. We grow plants from seeds, knowing we
won't be able to harvest them for months. We invest in our retirement.
