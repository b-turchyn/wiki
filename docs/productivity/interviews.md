# Interviews

Some tips:

- For behavioural questions, leverage the _S.T.A.R._ method:
  1. _Situation_. Describe the scenario you found yourself in.
  2. _Task_. Explain what you believed you needed to do.
  3. _Action_. What steps did you take?
  4. _Result_. What happened after everything was done? Were you successful or
     not? In either case, what did you learn from it?
