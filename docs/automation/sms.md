# SMS Automation

Depending on how you're sending messages, you have a few options:

_From an Android phone_, [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) is a good
option. It's not the easiest program to use, however it is very powerful and
allows for some crazy automations on your phone in general. A script can be
created that will send an SMS via your standard SMS application.

While I don't remember the specifics, I believe there are ways to get Tasker
scripts to trigger from an external source.

_Purely from a computer_, you could look at using a VOIP service that offers
messaging. A non-exhaustive list includes:

- [Twilio](https://twilio.com). I have used this in the past and it's worked
  fairly well for the low volumes I've sent.
- [Vonage](https://www.vonage.ca/en/communications-apis/sms/)
- [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/sms/)
