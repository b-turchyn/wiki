# Design Questions

- What is the effort to implement the feature?
  - Design, development, testing, deployment, ongoing maintenance
- How risky is the feature to implement?
- Are there other options not being considered? Why are they not viable?
- How is the feature going to be supported once it's live?
  - Is there monitoring?
  - Is there sufficient documentation for someone to fix issues that arise?
- How much tech debt will we accrue by implementing the feature as designed?
  - Will the developers be groveling in a month because "the code is a mess"?
  - Is the accrual of this tech debt acceptable?
