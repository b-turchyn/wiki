# Game Design Documents

A game design document (GDD) is considered required for the creation of any
game. It provides guidance to the whole team working on it and outlines the key
points: the plot, characters, core concepts, game mechanics, and theme.

[GameDesigning.org has an article](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/game-design-document/)
for writing your own GDD.
