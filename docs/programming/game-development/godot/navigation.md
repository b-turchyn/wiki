# Navigation in Godot

References in the official docs:

- [Using NavigationAgents](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationagents.html)
- [NavigationAgent2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_navigationagent2d.html)

Other places to learn from:

- [This tutorial series by GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/intro-to-steering-behaviors/)
  covers steering behaviours. It's written for Godot 3, but the principles still
  seem solid (still working through it). You'll have to mentally translate from
  Godot 3 code to Godot 4 code in some areas.
