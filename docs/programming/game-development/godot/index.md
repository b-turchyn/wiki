# Godot Game Engine

## Pixel Art Game Settings

I found these instructions from
[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzbxoZFsU2Y)

Enable advanced settings to make some settings visible.

- Rendering / 2D:
  - Snap 2D Transforms to Pixel: On
- Rendering / Textures:
  - Default Texture Filter: Nearest
- Display / Window:
  - Viewport Width/Height: pick a multiple that will evenly divide into 720p,
    1080p, 1440p, and 2160p (4K). 320x180 is a good option.
  - Stretch: Viewport
  - Window Width/Height Override: a multiple of your viewport width/height, i.e.
    1280x720. Without this your game window will be small.
