  amazing videos about water shaders in Unity and [Godot](godot/). She did a
  fantastic job describing her thought process. I'm excited to see what she
  creates.

  [video on the code behind Undertale](https://youtu.be/hKxtQ0CUVFE). This

  developers to make games not to be addictive slot machines (lookin' at you,
  microtransactions), but as creative acts.
- [DevDuck](https://www.youtube.com/@DevDuck) produces devlogs in
  [Godot](godot/) and have been fairly interesting.
