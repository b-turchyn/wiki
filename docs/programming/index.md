  - A great collection of information about how computers draw curves using math
    (lots and lots of math). Lots of visuals, reads fairly easy. It's great.

## Concepts

- [Digraphs and Trigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs):
  sequences of two or three characters in source code that are treated by single
  characters by the compiler.
