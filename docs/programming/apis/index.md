# APIs

Some helpful resources for API development:

- [The Design of Web APIs](https://www.manning.com/books/the-design-of-web-apis)
  by Arnaud Lauret is available to read online for free on the website, but can
  also be purchased in eBook and print formats (print copy includes the eBook!)
- I often refer back to MDN's
  [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
  reference, particularly when dealing with business logic errors.
