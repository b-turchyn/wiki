Conway's Law states that organizations build and design systems that mirror the
already-present organizational layout. If you have four teams working on a
compiler, you're likely to get a four-pass compiler.

The _Reverse Conway Maneuver_ is to structure your organization to match how you
want your system to be structured. As an example, if you want a four-pass
compiler, then your team should be broken down into four groups.
