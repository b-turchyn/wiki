# Microcontrollers

I have worked with these microcontrollers in the past:

- Arduino (Atmega328P)
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- ESP32

I'm a fan of the ESP8266; it has WiFi connectivity and so it's great for MQTT
and IoT usages.

The [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) libraries are some of the best for connecting
microcontroller sensors into your [Home Assistant](/devops/home-assistant.md)

## ESP8266

Random Nerd Tutorials has
[great diagrams on the pinouts](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/),
as the GPIO pins do not align with the PCB labelling. Additionally, some of the
pins have specific use cases and can't be used for external components.
