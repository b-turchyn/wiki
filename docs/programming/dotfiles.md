# Dotfiles

Collections of configuration files, typically used on \*nix-based environments.

Some interesting dotfiles:

- [Mine!](https://github.com/b-turchyn/dotfiles)
- [Ben Orenstein (r00k)](https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles)
  - His talk on [Expert-Level Vim](https://youtu.be/SkdrYWhh-8s) is still one of
    my favourite videos on using Vim effectively.
- [Nick Janetakis (nickjj)](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles)
  - I learned about [Vim's](devops/vim.md)'s `autocomplete` and `spell` features
    from [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/2f8h45YR494) he published.
