# TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed version of
[Javascript](programming/languages/javascript/index.md), built by Microsoft. If
it's usable in Javascript, it's usable in TypeScript.

Interesting / useful projects with TypeScript:

- [Are the types wrong?](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io)),
  created by Andrew Branch ([GitHub](https://github.com/andrewbranch))
  ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/atcb)) who currently works at Microsoft on
  TypeScript

  > This project attempts to analyze npm package contents for issues with their
  > TypeScript types, particularly ESM-related module resolution issues.

  - This seems to be similar to [publint](https://publint.dev/) for
    [Javascript](programming/languages/javascript/index.md), but specifically
    for TypeScript.
