# Learning

Everyone should strive to learn something new every day. It's also a good idea
to try to learn in public, since others can benefit from what you learn. This
creates a positive feedback loop amongst others.

## TIL Repos

TIL (Today I Learned) repos are repositories that people contribute to at least
daily of something they learned that day.

Some examples:
- [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)
- [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)
