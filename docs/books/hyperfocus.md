# Hyperfocus

[[link]](https://chrisbailey.com/hyperfocus/)

Chris Bailey's book focuses primarily on controlling your attention so that you
can get done what you want to get done (i.e. avoiding
[context switching](/productivity/context-switching.md)). This does not cover
prioritization techniques, what to do, or how to do it.

The primary focus is on two separate techniques: _hyperfocus_ and
_scatterfocus_.

- Hyperfocus: focusing outward on one specific task, filling as much of your
  [attentional space](psychology/attentional-space.md) as possible without
  exceeding it
- Scatterfocus: focusing inward on many things to connect ideas together

## Hyperfocus

## Scatterfocus

Scatterfocus is when your brain is its most [creative](/creativity/index.md).
Scatterfocus[^1]:

1. Lets you set intentions and plan for the future
2. Lets you recharge
3. Fosters creativity

This is different than letting your mind wander. Scatterfocus is
_intentional[^2]_ and uses your
[default mode network](/health/default-mode-network.md).

Bailey differentiates between three styles of scatterfocus, noted below.

### Capture Mode

The goal of Capture Mode is to record anything that is floating around in your
mind. Allocate 15 minutes with no distractions. With pen and paper, write down
anything you feel is "valuable and actionable"[^3]. By capturing these things,
they can be actioned during a Hyperfocus session and help reduce
[distractions](/productivity/distraction.md) during those sessions.

### Problem Crunching Mode

Designed for brainstorming solutions to a problem. Think about one problem and
think about it from multiple angles. Capture any notable ideas you have.

This seems like it would go well with a
[10x10 Design Process](https://blog.elementary.io/10x10-design-process/).

### Habitual Mode

Habitual mode is when you do something you enjoy that doesn't occupy a lot of
your [attentional space](/psychology/attentional-space.md). This could be
something like going for a walk in a quiet area or bouncing a ball.

The habit should be something you enjoy so you want to do it, but not so
enjoyable that it occupies all of your attentional space. Creative thoughts need
to be captured. "A creative thought is useless if it goes unnoticed."[^4]
