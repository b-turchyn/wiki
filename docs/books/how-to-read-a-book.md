# How To Read A Book

Authors: Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren

> Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large
> number of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading. The
> person who can perform more of them is better able to read.

## General Insights

- I think this book does a good job up front about defining the scope of what
  Adler and Van Doren want to cover. The purpose of this book is to teach people
  how to read to increase your understanding of a topic. It also notes that
  reading for entertainment purposes is a valid reason to read, but is outside
  the scope of this; I appreciate that it's not looked down on.

## Part One: The Dimensions of Reading

### The Goals of Reading: Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding

- Reading can mean two different things; it can mean to increase your
  understanding, or to increase how much information you know.
- In the latter, you may already understand something, but are simply gathering
  more information on the topic. More understanding is not gained from that
  reading, only more information. What you read is something you already
  understand.
- In the former however, you are reading about a topic of which you do not
  completely understand. The goal of this reading is _to understand more_, not
  _to know more_. You are building up the ability to comprehend more information
  in the future, not specifically retain more information.
- Both of these constitute learning, but in different forms.

There are four different levels of reading:

1. Elementary reading. Can you recognize the letters and words on the page? What
   does the sentence say? (See: [Learning To
   Read](/reading/learning-to-read.md))
2. Inspectional reading. The goal with this style is to skim the book as fast as
   possible, and get a feel for high-level questions about the text. What is the
   structure of the book? What kind of book is it? Much of this information can
   be gained simply by looking at the table of contents.

   See: [Skimming](/reading/skimming.md)
3. Analytical reading. Thorough reading, with an unlimited amount of time. This
   is very active reading, and is the minimum level required to _understand_ the
   contents of what you're reading. The previous two levels simply aren't active
   enough to provide any sufficient understanding.
4. Syntopical reading. This involves reading multiple books about the same
   topic, and then comparing and contrasting what you have learned and
   understood to then construct an analysis of the topic. That analysis may or
   may not be in any of the books, but you have understood enough to be able to
   produce a new take on things.
