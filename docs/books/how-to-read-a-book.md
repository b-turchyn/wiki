# How To Read A Book

Authors: Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren

> Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large
> number of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading. The
> person who can perform more of them is better able to read.

## General Insights

- I think this book does a good job up front about defining the scope of what
  Adler and Van Doren want to cover. The purpose of this book is to teach people
  how to read to increase your understanding of a topic. It also notes that
  reading for entertainment purposes is a valid reason to read, but is outside
  the scope of this; I appreciate that it's not looked down on.

## Part One: The Dimensions of Reading

### The Goals of Reading: Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding

- Reading can mean two different things; it can mean to increase your
  understanding, or to increase how much information you know.
- In the latter, you may already understand something, but are simply gathering
  more information on the topic. More understanding is not gained from that
  reading, only more information. What you read is something you already
  understand.
- In the former however, you are reading about a topic of which you do not
  completely understand. The goal of this reading is _to understand more_, not
  _to know more_. You are building up the ability to comprehend more information
  in the future, not specifically retain more information.
- Both of these constitute learning, but in different forms.
