  My notes on Austin Kleon's book "Keep Going". It's a great book to read
  through and should be on the desk of any creative for when they get into a
  rut.

# Keep Going

## Book References

A list of other books or literary works that Austin references:

- _Daily Rituals_ by Mason Currey
- _Getting Things Done_ by David Allen
- _The Power of Myth_ by Joseph Campbell
- [How to Graciously Say No to Anyone](https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/120472862666)
  by Alexandra Franzen
  - I couldn't find the original reference here with Alexandra's name on it, but
    this is an online place where Austin credits them.
