# Hitopadesha

The Hitopadesha is an ancient Indian text written by _Narayana_. It roughly
translates to "beneficial advice".

Likely written between 800 and 950 CE. The last surviving text is from roughly
the 12th century.

Jay Shetty writes the name as _Hitopade≈õa_, however Wikipedia writes the name as
_Hitopadesha_.

In the Hitopadesha, the mind is compared to a drunken monkey that's been bitten
by a scorpion and haunted by a ghost. (see:
[Monkey Brain](productivity/monkey-brain.md))
