# Effortless

The focus of this book is to do things the _right way_ such that you're
accomplishing what you want to get done without burning yourself out. Motivation
isn't enough to get things done. One challenge is to do the right things, the
second (which this book addresses) is _how_ to do those things so that you don't
burn out.

The goal: easy but pointless things become harder, and hard but worthwhile
things become easier.

This process is broken down into three parts:
1. Effortless State. Clear the clutter in your head so that it's easier to
   process new information and can make clear, level-headed decisions.
2. Effortless Action. Simplify the process by which you get stuff done. Find
   ways to sustain your momentum.
3. Effortless Results. Find ways to turn your linear results to residual
   results.
