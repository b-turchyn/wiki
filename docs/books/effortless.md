# Effortless

Author: Greg McKeown

## Introduction

> He felt like the tragic character Boxer the Horse in George Orwell's _Animal
> Farm_, described as the farm's most dedicated laborer whose answer to every
> problem, every setback, was "I will work harder" -- that is, until he
> collapsed from overwork and was sent to the knacker's yard.

> Burnout is not a badge of honor.

The focus of this book is to do things the _right way_ such that you're
accomplishing what you want to get done without burning yourself out. Motivation
isn't enough to get things done. One challenge is to do the right things, the
second (which this book addresses) is _how_ to do those things so that you don't
burn out.

The goal: easy but pointless things become harder, and hard but worthwhile
things become easier.

This process is broken down into three parts:

1. Effortless State. Clear the clutter in your head so that it's easier to
   process new information and can make clear, level-headed decisions.
2. Effortless Action. Simplify the process by which you get stuff done. Find
   ways to sustain your momentum.
3. Effortless Results. Find ways to turn your linear results to residual
   results.

## Part I: Effortless State

The _Effortless State_ can be defined as _feeling lighter_. This is both from
the feeling of being burdened (i.e. "I feel like there's a weight off my
shoulders"), but also a from a happiness perspective (i.e. "I'm not about to
snap at everything").

### Chapter 1: Invert

We tend to equate "hard" with "valuable" and "easy" with "trivial" -- that the
amount of effort put in has a direct correlation to the value it has. We apply
this to our work in most cases, and feel guilty if we got a lot done with little
effort, as if we cheated.

An alternative way of looking at this could be "how can I make this essential
task easy?". In general, McKeown suggests always asking "what if the opposite
were true?". Take a fact or opinion then ask that question, and evaluate the
results.

If something seems impossible to achieve, look for indirect ways of making
incremental progress.
[William Wilberforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce)
attempted to abolish the slave trade in Britain, but the British Parliament was
not interested in making changes here. Instead, Wilberforce was able to remove a
maritime law that prevented search and seizure of ships flying under a neutral
flag (under which most slave traders flew). By doing so, slave ships were able
to be seized, cutting off a lot of the maritime slave trade.

Make decisions based on what you deem to be important, not what everyone else is
doing. When every other airline had fancy tickets, Southwest Airlines opted to
print their tickets on ordinary paper. The information on the ticket was more
important than what the ticket was printed on.

> when you're just getting started, one answer is to say: 'Why don't you just
> start a different business you can push downhill?' " -- Seth Godin

"Easier" does not mean "inferior". Look for situations where even the smallest
bit of effort moves the important stuff forward.

### Chapter 2: Enjoy

Having fun when you haven't accomplished the important things becomes _the dark
playground_[^1]. So if you want to actually enjoy your fun time, accomplish
something first.

[^1]:
    I first heard this term used by Tim Urban during his
    [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

Often things that are good for us in the long-term are not enjoyable in the
short-term (exercising, meditating, eating healthy, etc). This is known as a
_lag indicator_. Look for ways to reduce the lag between effort and reward. For
example, do chores while listening to a podcast or music.

McKeown suggests pairing mundane, must-do work with fun things. Music is one of
the things McKeown touches on frequently. Almost everyone likes music, so find
something that matches the task before you.

> and get into a groove.

Other examples provided:

- Treating the weekly family financial meeting as a date rather than a chore by
  bringing out chocolate covered almonds and putting on good music on repeat.
- Putting on Disney songs while cleaning up after dinner so the whole family
  sings along.

Find rituals to form our habits around. Rituals are _how_ you perform the habit.
If you can embrace the ritual, the habit will also form.

### Chapter 3: Release

Keep an eye out for Stormtroopers[^2]: outdated goals or desires that you're
continuing to work toward but don't actually want or need. As these pile up,
they take up more brain power and cause you to not be able to focus[^3].

[^2]:
    The origin of "Stormtrooper" here came from McKeown's wife Anna. After
    McKeown went had it in is head for a long time that he wanted a Stormtrooper
    costume, he went to try it on and then immediately realized that he didn't
    want it. Now Anna will ask "Is this a Stormtrooper?" if something McKeown is
    working toward doesn't seem like it holds value anymore.

[^3]:
    I see callbacks here to Tiago Forte's [PARA](writing/para.md) organizational
    method: move things into the archive when they no longer serve a purpose.

As a real world example, social media tends to thrive on complaining. The more
we complain, the more you hear complaints and the easier it is to complain about
things. By contrast, the more you practice gratitude, the more you notice things
you should be grateful for and the easier it becomes to be grateful for everyday
things.

> Gratitude is a powerful, catalytic thing. It starves negative emotions of the
> oxygen they need to survive. It also generates a positive, self-sustaining
> system wherever and whenever it is applied.

Similarly, avoid holding onto grudges. They're easier to focus on than being
grateful for things, but is far more toxic to your mental well-being. Holding a
grudge means that someone who slighted you holds agency over your happiness.

Accept the things you can't control. People have their flaws. If you can't
control something, you have the choice to ruminate on it or to accept it as it
is. The latter frees you from having to worry about it.

### Chapter 4: Rest

Consistently working hard will lead to burnout. To be able to grow and maintain
peak performance, rest is also required.

The amount of work you do should be no more than you can recover from and should
not completely exhaust you.

> "To maximize gains from long-term practice, individuals must avoid exhaustion
> and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on
> a daily or weekly basis." -- K Anders Ericsson

- I have personally felt this back in 2019;
  [I wrote about it on my blog](https://brianturchyn.net/burnout/)
- The Stress-Rest cycle is also talked about in _Peak Performance_.

To keep up a healthy amount of work, do the most essential things at the start
of your day, when you have the most discipline and energy. Break that time into
work sessions that are no more than 90 minutes each. Schedule 10-15 breaks in
between them.

Don't ignore fatigue. If you feel it building up, take a break and rest so you
can continue later. The break doesn't need to be long; even a one minute break
in some situations is enough.

Sleep is one of the most common things that we neglect, yet is critical for us
to be able to perform well. A single night of "good sleep" is not enough to make
up for the past several days of poor sleep; we have accumulated too much sleep
debt. This is one of the easiest and simplest things you can do to improve your
life.

_See: [Sleep](/health/sleep.md)_

When a full night's sleep isn't possible, take a nap. (See:
[Naps](/health/sleep.md#naps)) Aim for a 90 minute nap for a full recovery.
