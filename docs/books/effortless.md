# Effortless

The focus of this book is to do things the _right way_ such that you're
accomplishing what you want to get done without burning yourself out. Motivation
isn't enough to get things done. One challenge is to do the right things, the
second (which this book addresses) is _how_ to do those things so that you don't
burn out.

The goal: easy but pointless things become harder, and hard but worthwhile
things become easier.

This process is broken down into three parts:

1. Effortless State. Clear the clutter in your head so that it's easier to
   process new information and can make clear, level-headed decisions.
2. Effortless Action. Simplify the process by which you get stuff done. Find
   ways to sustain your momentum.
3. Effortless Results. Find ways to turn your linear results to residual
   results.

## Part I: Effortless State

The _Effortless State_ can be defined as _feeling lighter_. This is both from
the feeling of being burdened (i.e. "I feel like there's a weight off my
shoulders"), but also a from a happiness perspective (i.e. "I'm not about to
snap at everything").

### Chapter 1: Invert

We tend to equate "hard" with "valuable" and "easy" with "trivial" -- that the
amount of effort put in has a direct correlation to the value it has. We apply
this to our work in most cases, and feel guilty if we got a lot done with little
effort, as if we cheated.

An alternative way of looking at this could be "how can I make this essential
task easy?". In general, McKeown suggests always asking "what if the opposite
were true?". Take a fact or opinion then ask that question, and evaluate the
results.

If something seems impossible to achieve, look for indirect ways of making
incremental progress. [William
Wilberforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce) attempted to
abolish the slave trade in Britain, but the British Parliament was not
interested in making changes here. Instead, Wilberforce was able to remove a
maritime law that prevented search and seizure of ships flying under a neutral
flag (under which most slave traders flew). By doing so, slave ships were able
to be seized, cutting off a lot of the maritime slave trade.

Make decisions based on what you deem to be important, not what everyone else is
doing. When every other airline had fancy tickets, Southwest Airlines opted to
print their tickets on ordinary paper. The information on the ticket was more
important than what the ticket was printed on.

"Easier" does not mean "inferior". Look for situations where even the smallest
bit of effort moves the important stuff forward.
