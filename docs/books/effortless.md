# Effortless

Author: Greg McKeown

## Introduction

> He felt like the tragic character Boxer the Horse in George Orwell's _Animal
> Farm_, described as the farm's most dedicated laborer whose answer to every
> problem, every setback, was "I will work harder" -- that is, until he
> collapsed from overwork and was sent to the knacker's yard.

> Burnout is not a badge of honor.

The focus of this book is to do things the _right way_ such that you're
accomplishing what you want to get done without burning yourself out. Motivation
isn't enough to get things done. One challenge is to do the right things, the
second (which this book addresses) is _how_ to do those things so that you don't
burn out.

The goal: easy but pointless things become harder, and hard but worthwhile
things become easier.

This process is broken down into three parts:

1. Effortless State. Clear the clutter in your head so that it's easier to
   process new information and can make clear, level-headed decisions.
2. Effortless Action. Simplify the process by which you get stuff done. Find
   ways to sustain your momentum.
3. Effortless Results. Find ways to turn your linear results to residual
   results.

## Part I: Effortless State

The _Effortless State_ can be defined as _feeling lighter_. This is both from
the feeling of being burdened (i.e. "I feel like there's a weight off my
shoulders"), but also a from a happiness perspective (i.e. "I'm not about to
snap at everything").

### Chapter 1: Invert

We tend to equate "hard" with "valuable" and "easy" with "trivial" -- that the
amount of effort put in has a direct correlation to the value it has. We apply
this to our work in most cases, and feel guilty if we got a lot done with little
effort, as if we cheated.

An alternative way of looking at this could be "how can I make this essential
task easy?". In general, McKeown suggests always asking "what if the opposite
were true?". Take a fact or opinion then ask that question, and evaluate the
results.

If something seems impossible to achieve, look for indirect ways of making
incremental progress.
[William Wilberforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce)
attempted to abolish the slave trade in Britain, but the British Parliament was
not interested in making changes here. Instead, Wilberforce was able to remove a
maritime law that prevented search and seizure of ships flying under a neutral
flag (under which most slave traders flew). By doing so, slave ships were able
to be seized, cutting off a lot of the maritime slave trade.

Make decisions based on what you deem to be important, not what everyone else is
doing. When every other airline had fancy tickets, Southwest Airlines opted to
print their tickets on ordinary paper. The information on the ticket was more
important than what the ticket was printed on.

> "If you can think about how hard it is to push a business uphill, particularly
> when you're just getting started, one answer is to say: 'Why don't you just
> start a different business you can push downhill?' " -- Seth Godin

"Easier" does not mean "inferior". Look for situations where even the smallest
bit of effort moves the important stuff forward.

### Chapter 2: Enjoy

Having fun when you haven't accomplished the important things becomes _the dark
playground_[^1]. So if you want to actually enjoy your fun time, accomplish
something first.

[^1]:
    I first heard this term used by Tim Urban during his
    [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

Often things that are good for us in the long-term are not enjoyable in the
short-term (exercising, meditating, eating healthy, etc). This is known as a
_lag indicator_. Look for ways to reduce the lag between effort and reward. For
example, do chores while listening to a podcast or music.

McKeown suggests pairing mundane, must-do work with fun things. Music is one of
the things McKeown touches on frequently. Almost everyone likes music, so find
something that matches the task before you.

> Don't underestimate the power of the right soundtrack to ditch the drudgery
> and get into a groove.

Other examples provided:

- Treating the weekly family financial meeting as a date rather than a chore by
  bringing out chocolate covered almonds and putting on good music on repeat.
- Putting on Disney songs while cleaning up after dinner so the whole family
  sings along.

Find rituals to form our habits around. Rituals are _how_ you perform the habit.
If you can embrace the ritual, the habit will also form.

### Chapter 3: Release

Keep an eye out for Stormtroopers[^2]: outdated goals or desires that you're
continuing to work toward but don't actually want or need. As these pile up,
they take up more brain power and cause you to not be able to focus[^3].

[^2]:
    The origin of "Stormtrooper" here came from McKeown's wife Anna. After
    McKeown went had it in is head for a long time that he wanted a Stormtrooper
    costume, he went to try it on and then immediately realized that he didn't
    want it. Now Anna will ask "Is this a Stormtrooper?" if something McKeown is
    working toward doesn't seem like it holds value anymore.

[^3]:
    I see callbacks here to Tiago Forte's [PARA](writing/para.md) organizational
    method: move things into the archive when they no longer serve a purpose.

As a real world example, social media tends to thrive on complaining. The more
we complain, the more you hear complaints and the easier it is to complain about
things. By contrast, the more you practice gratitude, the more you notice things
you should be grateful for and the easier it becomes to be grateful for everyday
things.

> Gratitude is a powerful, catalytic thing. It starves negative emotions of the
> oxygen they need to survive. It also generates a positive, self-sustaining
> system wherever and whenever it is applied.

Similarly, avoid holding onto grudges. They're easier to focus on than being
grateful for things, but is far more toxic to your mental well-being. Holding a
grudge means that someone who slighted you holds agency over your happiness.

Accept the things you can't control. People have their flaws. If you can't
control something, you have the choice to ruminate on it or to accept it as it
is. The latter frees you from having to worry about it.

### Chapter 4: Rest

Consistently working hard will lead to burnout. To be able to grow and maintain
peak performance, rest is also required.

The amount of work you do should be no more than you can recover from and should
not completely exhaust you.

> "To maximize gains from long-term practice, individuals must avoid exhaustion
> and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on
> a daily or weekly basis." -- K Anders Ericsson

- I have personally felt this back in 2019;
  [I wrote about it on my blog](https://brianturchyn.net/burnout/)
- The Stress-Rest cycle is also talked about in _Peak Performance_.

To keep up a healthy amount of work, do the most essential things at the start
of your day, when you have the most discipline and energy. Break that time into
work sessions that are no more than 90 minutes each. Schedule 10-15 breaks in
between them.

Don't ignore fatigue. If you feel it building up, take a break and rest so you
can continue later. The break doesn't need to be long; even a one minute break
in some situations is enough.

Sleep is one of the most common things that we neglect, yet is critical for us
to be able to perform well. A single night of "good sleep" is not enough to make
up for the past several days of poor sleep; we have accumulated too much sleep
debt. This is one of the easiest and simplest things you can do to improve your
life.

_See: [Sleep](/health/sleep.md)_

When a full night's sleep isn't possible, take a nap. (See:
[Naps](/health/sleep.md#naps)) Aim for a 90 minute nap for a full recovery.

### Chapter 5: Notice

There are countless things competing for our attention. This interferes with
our ability to observe and notice things. If we can train our "attention
muscles", then we can take more information in with less effort.

> Listening isn't hard; it's stopping our mind from wandering that's hard.

Give your full focus and attention to those you're speaking with. If a
[relationship bid](psychology/relationship-bids.md) comes your way, respond with
either turning toward or turning against. This ensures you're present.

If someone comes to you for advice, avoid providing recommendations. Instead,
aim to ask questions to help the other person come to their own conclusions.
They may not be telling you the whole story, and your situations are going to be
different compared to theirs. Quakers had a system called the _Clearness
Committee_ which effectively performed that.

## Part II: Effortless Action

The primary goal with action is continuous practice: to get to the point where
you try without trying, for your actions to become instinctive. Getting to this
point requires deliberate practice, but too much time invested and you'll hit
the point of diminishing returns (or possibly even negative returns).

When practising, you want to invest just enough time so that you hit that
optimal juice-to-squeeze ratio of time-to-value.

Accomplish what matters by trying less.

### Chapter 6: Define

The easiest way to kill a project is to not define what "done" looks like.
By defining "done", you can perform the steps required, finish it up, then move
on to something else.

When you have lots of things to get done, consider a "done for the day" list.
When looking at your to-do list, if you see something on there that will haunt
you if you don't get it done today, put it on the list. You then work from that
list first.

_See: [Swedish Death Cleaning](psychology/swedish-death-cleaning.md)_

### Chapter 7: Start

The first step taken by Netflix to test out the product was to mail a used CD
from one person to the other, just to see if sending CDs and DVDs in the mail
was even viable (in software development, we'd consider this the MVP: Minimum
Viable Product).

To begin, first take the first thing you believe you need to do. What's stopping
you from actioning it? Find the first thing preventing you from performing the
action. Repeat until you have something you can comfortably action. The
remaining items are your To Do list.

Apply April Perry's concept of a _Microburst_: ten minutes of highly focused
work that has an immediate impact on your project.

Do your best to avoid distractions in [the now](/psychology/the-present.md).
Twitter and [social media](/social-media/index.md) can distract you from your
goals.

### Chapter 8: Simplify

> No matter how simple the step, it's still easier to take no step.

Amazon holds the patent on one-click purchasing of online goods after Jeff Bezos
set that as the goal for the online marketplace.

For any project, ask the question: what are the minimum steps required for
completion? The goal is to identify what is _unnecessary_. This isn't getting
rid of critical pieces.

When being asked to do something, you don't have to go the extra mile. You can
do exactly what was asked of you. Going beyond has limited value, because by
definition, going beyond is doing more than is necessary. Don't add anything
extra. Similarly, don't start with complex and then make it simpler; start with
nothing, and then add on to it.

### Chapter 9: Progress

> There is no mastery without mistakes. And there is no learning later without
> the courage to be rubbish.

We learn the most by making mistakes. Our goal should be to make those mistakes
as quickly as possible, and to have the cost of those mistakes be as low as
possible. For example, you'd rather waste $20 than $2,000, and you'd rather find
out it was a waste now rather than in a month.

Over-achievers tend to be obsessed with perfection. In this case, perfection
means unnecessary things got done (see [Chapter 8:
Simplify](#chapter-8-simplify)). Avoid this by starting off with the ugly.

It's worth noting that this is not an excuse to not try or to deliberately
produce garbage. The goal is to try something and have the failures come quickly
so that you can learn from those failures and make better mistakes -- and better
quality work -- afterward.

### Chapter 10: Pace

> Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.

> Never less than X, never more than Y.

A common approach to getting things done is to "power through": to push yourself
so hard that you need to take a break. What then happens is you rest, then feel
like you need to make up for lost time, so you "power through" again. This cycle
repeats itself until burnout hits.

Instead of setting a lower bound, set an upper bound. Set a value that is below
your usual limit, so at the end you're wanting to do more and haven't gotten
tired. This is, effectively, pacing yourself.

Pacing yourself has two benefits. The first is the aforementioned lack of
burnout. The other is your focus is more maintained. If you get tired, you're
more likely to go off on tangents.

Pacing yourself means being able to handle the unexpected issues that will get
in the way of your goals. You have "gas in the tank" so you can respond
appropriately and still be able to maintain your momentum going forward.

## Part III: Effortless Results

### Chapter 11: Learn

If our goal is residual results, we want to focus on learning things that can be
applied over and over, rather than one specific thing for a specific purpose.
While those can be useful, they yield linear results instead.

Aim to learn principles, not methods. A principle is a concept that can be
applied broadly and repeatedly. An example of this is understanding _why_
something is done a certain way or _how_ something works.

Look for commonalities between seemingly distinct principles. By doing so,
you'll be able to apply principles from different disciplines to new areas.
Newton's third law has applications across the world.

Aim to understand the core concepts first. As you learn more, you will begin to
figure out what is critical, what is not, and what can be related to other
topics.

Combining principles from different disciplines pays off. You get to combine the
best knowledge gathered by some of the smartest people in each discipline into
something new. The combining of that knowledge breeds novelty and new ideas.

Reading is an excellent way to gain this knowledge. But don't read to say that
you've read; instead, your goal should be to absorb as much of that information
as possible.

 - Take a few minutes after each chapter to summarize the key points from what
   you just read. Distill it down into no more than a single page.
 - Collect and share that information in a
   [Zettelkasten](/writing/zettelkasten.md) or [digital
   garden](/writing/digital-garden.md) so you have an easy-to-use reference.

Our goal is residual results; taking this knowledge and synthesizing it means we
can gain a reputation as someone who knows things that nobody else knows.
Leverage what others know, combine together, and produce something that nobody
else knows.

### Chapter 12: Lift

Two effective ways of exponentially passing along information to others:

1. Stories. Stories connect the past and present together, keeping the knowledge
   and the lessons alive.
2. Teaching others to teach. First learn how to teach. Then teach others how to
   teach what you've learned. Don't just teach what you know; that's just
   regurgitating knowledge. Someone truly knows the information when they can
   teach it to somebody else. The _Sesame Street Rule_ is that you should go for
   the straightforward message that can be easily understood and repeated.

Teaching others has an exponential effect. If you teach a small group about
something and they are able to teach that information, then they can go and do
the same thing.
