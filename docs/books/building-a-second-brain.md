# Building a Second Brain

## Book Notes

### Chapter 2: What Is a Second Brain

Accomplishing anything requires knowledge. The average employee in the United
States spends 76 hours per year looking for information they misplaced. 26% of a
knowledge worker's day involves collecting and consolidating information across
various systems; they only find the info they're looking for 56% of the time.

Due to the constant onslaught of information in today's age, it is no longer
possible for humans to hold onto all of the information they need in their
heads. We need reference material, which means we need to write things down.

A _[Second Brain](/writing/second-brain.md)_ is a more refined version of a
[commonplace book](/writing/commonplace-book.md): a combination of a study
notebook, personal journal, and sketchbook for new ideas. It is a living
collection of notes that you can refer back to at any point.

A _[note](/writing/notes.md)_ is a unit of knowledge captured and stored outside
of your head. It can be a bulletpoint list, an image, or a quote. It's something
that you have identified has value for you, and has been synthesized and
interpreted by you. It exists and has value on its own, but can be combined with
other notes to create something more.
