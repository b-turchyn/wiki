# Building a Second Brain

## Book Notes

### Chapter 2: What Is a Second Brain

Accomplishing anything requires knowledge. The average employee in the United
States spends 76 hours per year looking for information they misplaced. 26% of a
knowledge worker's day involves collecting and consolidating information across
various systems; they only find the info they're looking for 56% of the time.

Due to the constant onslaught of information in today's age, it is no longer
possible for humans to hold onto all of the information they need in their
heads. We need reference material, which means we need to write things down.

A _[Second Brain](/writing/second-brain.md)_ is a more refined version of a
[commonplace book](/writing/commonplace-book.md): a combination of a study
notebook, personal journal, and sketchbook for new ideas. It is a living
collection of notes that you can refer back to at any point.

A _[note](/writing/notes.md)_ is a unit of knowledge captured and stored outside
of your head. It can be a bulletpoint list, an image, or a quote. It's something
that you have identified has value for you, and has been synthesized and
interpreted by you. It exists and has value on its own, but can be combined with
other notes to create something more.

### Chapter 3: How a Second Brain Works

There are four key roles to a Second Brain:
1. Make ideas concrete. We can offload knowledge to the Second Brain so that our mind can focus on working with those ideas.
2. Reveal associations between ideas. Those who are more creative are better at making and recognizing relationships and associations between ideas. Keeping all of your ideas together helps facilitate that.
3. Incubate ideas over time. This helps avoid [recency bias](psychology/recency-bias.md) by collecting ideas over months and years, rather than in the heat of the moment.
4. Sharpen your unique perspective. The key part of a Second Brain is to refine your own thinking so that you can actually use it. You need to be abel to not only take in information, but actually use it. If you want to persuade someone, you need supporting information to back it up. This info can also help with [Writer's Block](writing/writers-block.md).

A digital note-taking app should fulfill the following requirements:
- Be able to interact with multimedia. Images, audio, etc.
- Be informal. Notes will be messy.
- Open-ended. Working with your PKM is a continuous process.
- Be action-oriented. You want to be able to capture thoughts and move on as fast as possible. 

The app you end up using will not be perfect. It will also be a personal choice. 

There are three stages of working with a Personal Knowledge Management system:
1. Remembering. Writing things down, making comments and annotations.
2. Connecting. This changes a PKM system from a memory tool to a thinking tool.
3. Creating. Using the information gathered to create something new, rather than just information hoarding.

Use the [CODE Method](writing/code-method.md) for feeding knowledge into your PKM system.
