# Tribes: We Need You To Lead Us

Author: Seth Godin

Seth first mentions Joel Spolsky, a software developer. One of his notable
contributions is [The Joel Test](programming/joel-test.md), a means of seeing
how good a software development team is.[^1]

Geography limitations have largely been eliminated since the internet became
generally accessible. [Social Media](social-media/index.md) has helped bridge
those gaps. But the internet is not a requirement of a tribe, just a means of
helping a tribe thrive.

There is a difference between management and [leadership](leadership/index.md).
"Management is about manipulating resources to get a known job done".
Leadership, on the other hand, "is about creating change that you believe in".

The concept of a manager stems from kings and royalty. A king uses power to
maintain status quo. Their direct reports have a vested interest in maintaining
that because of the compensation they receive. The same structure is applied in
many corporations. In the modern time, marketing gave those without power
leverage over the CEO/king and allowed for tribes to form.

The only constant is change; people want new, innovative ideas. Old and mediocre
ideas don't spread.

By definition, a _tribe_ has an opinion about a topic. They believe in it; if
it's a movement, they want the opposite to _not_ occur. A leader in this case
steps up and takes a position, connecting with that tribe to help guide them to
interconnect. Tesla[^2] as an example disrupted the automotive market by
bringing a fully electric vehicle to mainstream markets.

> Intractable problems fall in the face of movements.

When trying to improve a tribe, most leaders focus solely on growing and gaining
new members. While important, time is better spent helping the current tribe
effectively communicate by providing the right tools (such as
[Discord](technology/discord.md), a Subreddit, or a social media hashtag), or
"transforming the shared interest into a passionate goal and desire for change".

Ultimately, the goal of your tribe is to create a _movement_: viral change for
the better.

That movement comes from three key points, as defined by
[Bill Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bradley):

1. A story about the future the tribe is striving to achieve
2. A connection between the leader and the members of the tribe
3. A goal -- something to do and to work toward

Godin uses Wikipedia as an example here; Jimmy Wales provides all of this. The
fundraising emails sent out describe a story of free, open knowledge. The emails
themselves are a means of connecting to him. And the Wikipedia software provides
the necessary tooling to achieve both the communication amongst the tribe
members and the means of achieving their goal.

A _crowd_ is different than a _tribe_. Crowds lack leaders and lack
communication.

Godin argues that having 1,000 [true fans](marketing/true-fan.md) is enough to
support yourself, and that 1,000 true fans will form a tribe around you and your
work. Getting even one true fan is difficult and requires engaging with them. Be
generous and open with them (not unlike what Austin Kleon recommends in
[Show Your Work!](books/show-your-work.md)). Provide something exceptional and
novel.

> The party didn't take four minutes to organize; it took four years.

The internet has provided a means of reaching the masses; this means that almost
anyone has the potential to build something big.

    damage, of course.
