# Tribes: We Need You To Lead Us

Author: Seth Godin

Seth first mentions Joel Spolsky, a software developer. One of his notable
contributions is [The Joel Test](programming/joel-test.md), a means of seeing
how good a software development team is.[^joel]

Geography limitations have largely been eliminated since the internet became
generally accessible. [Social Media](social-media/index.md) has helped bridge
those gaps. But the internet is not a requirement of a tribe, just a means of
helping a tribe thrive.

[^joel]: Joel was also a co-founder of Stack Overflow, along-side Jeff Atwood.
