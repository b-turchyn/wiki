## Recipe Sites

Sites I source recipes from:

- [Grimgrains](https://grimgrains.com/) - Their
  [Sweet And Sour Lentils](https://grimgrains.com/site/sweet_and_sour_lentils.html)
  is one of my favourite go-to meals.
- [Allrecipes](https://allrecipes.com)
- [Budget Bytes](https://budgetbytes.com)
  - Tasty, (generally) healthy recipes with an emphasis on low price.
  - Because the ingredients are generally simple, it's easier to buy in bulk for
    meal prepping.

## Other Recipes

Recipes here I haven't done any tweaking to, so I can't call them "my own" or
have an exact copy as an article on the wiki.

- [Root Beer Pulled Pork](https://insanelygoodrecipes.com/root-beer-pulled-pork/)
  - Make this with Barq's Root Beer and Kraft Original BBQ Sauce, if available
    in your area. Fantastic and easy.
- [Mediterranean Turkey Bowls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/mediterranean-turkey-bowls/#recipe),
  Budget Bytes
- [Meal Prep Noodle Soup Jars](https://www.budgetbytes.com/meal-prep-noodle-soup-jars/#recipe)
  - It's ramen, yes, but is much healthier than what you'd get at the store. A
    soft-boiled egg could be added for something extra. Surprisingly filling. I
    used another hot sauce other than sriracha and it was still good.

I have had these recipes recommended to me, but I haven't tried or made them
yet:
