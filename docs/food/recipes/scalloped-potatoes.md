# Instructions

- In a small sauce pan, melt [butter](food/ingredients/butter.md) and blend in
  [flour](food/ingredients/flour.md#all-purpose-flour). Let sit for a minute.
- Whisk in the [milk](food/ingredients/milk.md), then season with
  [salt](food/ingredients/salt.md) and
  [cayenne pepper](food/ingredients/cayenne-pepper.md).
- Cook sauce on low until smooth and boiling, stirring occasionally with a
  whisk.
- Reduce heat and stir in 1 cup of the
  [cheese](food/ingredients/cheese.md#sharp-cheddar).
- Place a half of the sliced potatoes in a lightly greased one quart casserole
  dish.
- Pour half of cheese sauce over
  [potatoes](food/ingredients/potatoes.md#red-potatoes).
- Repeat with second layer of
  [potatoes](food/ingredients/potatoes.md#red-potatoes) and cheese sauce.
- Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese on top.
- Top with some [paprika](food/ingredients/paprika.md) for color.
- Bake uncovered for about 1 hour at 350Â°F.

# Notes

- The original recipe called for 1 tsp of salt. I felt like this was too much.
- I did 4 dashes of cayenne pepper to add more heat. This was much better.
- 2 cups of cheese feels more appropriate.
