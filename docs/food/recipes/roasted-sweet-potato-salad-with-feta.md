# Roasted Sweet Potato Salad with Feta

I adapted this recipe from
[one I found on Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/278938/roasted-sweet-potato-salad-with-feta/).
Specifically:

- Removed the watercress because I don't like them
- Substituted walnuts instead of cashews
- Removed the cilantro (I like cilantro, but a few people I often eat with have
  the gene that makes cilantro taste like soap)
- Reduced the amount of dressing in half (in my opinion it didn't need all of
  it)

Pretty happy with this. Simple to make, more filling that most salads, tasty,
and vegetarian.

| ----------------------------------------- | -----------: |

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350F
2. Peel and cube the sweet potatoes. In a roasting pan, put the sweet potatoes,
   olive oil, and cumin seeds. Add [salt](food/ingredients/salt.md) & pepper
   (2-3 grinds on the [salt](food/ingredients/salt.md) and pepper mills was
   enough for me). Mix together to evenly coat the sweet potato cubes.
3. Put the roasting pan into the oven for 45 minutes. Stir once at the half-way
   point.
4. Put the walnuts in an oven-safe pan or dish. With 15 minutes remaining on the
   timer for the sweet potatoes, put the dish in the lower rack in the oven.
   Pull out after 10-15 minutes (I did 15), or the desired fragrance.
5. Combine the spinach, arugula, and cilantro together to prepare for the
   dressing. To make things easier for yourself, combine it in a container with
   a sealable lid.
6. Make the dressing by combining the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, sugar,
   [salt](food/ingredients/salt.md), and pepper together into a small cup. Stir
   vigorously.
7. Pour the dressing over the greens, seal the container, and slightly shake to
   coat all of the greens. Begin plating your salad.
8. Put the crumbled or cubed feta cheese on top of your salad. As they become
   available, put the sweet potato and roasted walnuts as well.

[^1]:
    I just winged this; think of the walnuts as croutons. A little is nice, but
    don't overdo it.

    I did two grinds on the [salt](food/ingredients/salt.md) and pepper mills
    and this was plenty
