# Chili

Originally sourced from a Company's Coming cookbook, with some variations over
time.

Scales up linearly. Two batches will fit into a 6-quart (?) slow cooker. Not
sure about 3 batches. Makes a great dinner that can be made as hot and spicy as
you want

## Steps

1. Scramble-fry ground pork. Drain any excess fat. 
2. Dice the onion and green pepper. Aim for pieces just under 1cm<sup>3</sup>
3. Combine everything into the slow cooker. Stir well.
4. Cook:
    * 6-7 hours on Low
    * 3-3.5 hours on High

Stir before serving. Serve with grated cheddar cheese and tortilla chips. 

## Storage

* Keeps in the fridge for about 1 week after cooking
* Freezes and thaws well. When making large batches, put into single-serving
  containers. One serving for a whole meal is about 2 scoops of a ladel.
