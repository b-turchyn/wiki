# Chili Oil Ramen

I love this. It's not that hard to make, and if you plan things out correctly you can multithread a lot of the work here. For example, while the water for the noodles is heating up, you can prep the bowl of spices for the chili oil. You can also cook the egg while the noodles cook, but you'll need to plate the egg separately if you want to use the same skillet for heating the canola oil for the chili oil.
