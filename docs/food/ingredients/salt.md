# Salt

While there's a multitude of different types of salt from a chemistry
perspective, when cooking we're referring to sodium chloride -- table salt.

## Types of Salt

Common types of salt when cooking are:

- Table salt; this is when salt is very fine. It's commonly used as an
  ingredient in cooking in this form. This is commonly _iodized_, meaning iodine
  is added.
- Coarse salt; while this can be used for cooking, it's usually used more for
  frosting rims of cocktail glasses or a salt crust for fish/meat. The main
  benefit of course salt for cooking is that it can be easily pinched, meaning
  you can pick up a _pinch of salt_ very easily.
- Kosher salt; a form of course salt with no additives. If you're substituting
  kosher salt for table salt, you'll need to use ~1.5x more. I use kosher salt
  on my steaks.
- Seasoning salt; a combination of salts with spices and occasionally MSG.
