# Culture

We are often blind by our culture. It takes interacting with others outside of
your own culture or experiencing your other cultures to realize what your
culture truly is.

The idea of moving out early to strike out on your own is a construct of western
culture, where independence and individualism are critical. In other areas of
the world, these are more frowned upon.
