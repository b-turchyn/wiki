# Discord

Interesting Discord bots:
- [CouchBot](https://couch.bot/) sends notifications when someone goes live on a
  livestreaming platform. This seems to be one of the few that can do YouTube
  live streams properly rather than just a new YouTube video (Mee6 has that
  problem).
- [Mee6](https://mee6.xyz) seems to be one of the better moderation bots.
  There's some features I wish it had, but overall it seems fine. Has a free and
  premium offering.
- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/bots) has bots for both Discord and Slack for
  retrieving information on [Magic: The Gathering](games/mtg/index.md) cards.
- [Statbot](https://statbot.net) collects stats on messages sent, active users,
  voice chat person-hours, etc. Has a free and premium offering.

Useful Discord tools:
- [HammerTime](https://hammertime.cyou/) generates Discord time tags so that the
  date and/or time you enter will be in the correct time zone for the reader.
