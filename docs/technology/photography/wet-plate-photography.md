# Wet Plate Photography

Wet plate photography was one of the earliest forms of photography. The name
comes from having a plate of glass or metal covered in a light-sensitive
emulsion.

This emulsion contained silver halides, which reacted when exposed to light.

## Processes

- Daguerreotype was around in the 1840s through 1850s. The process involved
  dangerous chemicals like mercury and chlorine. Polished silver plates, or
  copper plates with silver coatings, were used.
- The _ambrotype_ process used glass plates, but couldn't be duplicated. Fewer
  dangerous chemicals were needed to develop ambrotype plates.
- The _tintype_ process was the cheapest and easiest, using a thin piece of
  metal with a dark lacquer.
