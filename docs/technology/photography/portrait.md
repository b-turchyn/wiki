## Online Dating Profile Pictures

_Content here sourced from [^1]_

On online dating sites, women are more likely to get a like by having photos
where they are standing alone, looking away, or smiling _with_ teeth. Men are
more likely to get a like when they are alone, smiling _without_ teeth, and
looking at the camera.

Candids perform better than posed photos (roughly 15% better).

Selfies perform poorly. You are better off having photos taken by friends.
Bathroom selfies perform even worse.

Black-and-white photos perform about twice as good as coloured photos.
