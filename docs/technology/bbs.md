# BBS

BBS stands for Bulletin Board System, the precursor to online forums. These were
typically old computers that you would call into with a modem and you'd get a
terminal prompt to interact with.

Many BBSs still exist today, mostly as Telnet or SSH servers, but some do still
exist as phone BBSs.

Interesting reading material about running a BBS:

   - The idea of running an online community has always appealed to me, as has
     the cypherpunk movement and old school hacking. I was a bit too young to
     get into BBSs, but this still scratches my nostalgia itch.
   - This article refers to [The Cave BBS](https://cavebbs.com/), which is still
     available via Telnet today.
