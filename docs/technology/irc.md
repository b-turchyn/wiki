# IRC

I've always liked the idea of IRC, but don't often use it. I'm more likely to
lurk in channels; it feels weird talking with random people online, but I think
this has more to do with social anxiety over a problem with the technology. IRC
itself feels like one of the few open standards still readily accessible,
actively discouraging walled gardens like [Discord](./discord.md).

I often lurk on:

- [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat)
- [Ergo.Chat](https://ergo.chat)

I run a test version of the Ergo.Chat software to fool around with, but it's not
externally accessible.

For IRC clients, I've used [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) with a
[ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/) IRC bouncer to stay logged in. I've also recently
started fooling around with [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/) as a web-based
IRC client.
