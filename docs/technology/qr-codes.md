Reading QR codes:

- [Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android),
  Android, by ZXing Team
  - I've been using this for years. It's not pretty, but it works well, collects
    zero data, and has been consistently reliable. Lots of other data-invasive
    scanners out there, and this one doesn't seem to have any of that in there.
