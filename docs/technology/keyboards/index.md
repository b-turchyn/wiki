# Keyboards

Keyboards I own:

- [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix) with [KAT
  Drifter](https://thekey.company/pages/kat-drifter) keycaps and
  [C<sup>3</sup>Equalz x TKC Tangerine
  switches](https://thekey.company/products/c3-tangerine-switches-r2)
- [Drop ALT](https://drop.com/buy/drop-alt-mechanical-keyboard) low profile with
  stock keycaps and [C<sup>3</sup>Equalz x TKC Banana Split
  switches](https://thekey.company/products/banana-split-switches)
- [Drop + OLKB Preonic V3](https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard)
  with stock keycaps and Kailh Bronze switches
- [IBM Model M (1986)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard)

I'm a big fan of [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/) on all of my keyboards for
its amazing customizability. 

Neat keyboard ideas:

- [Home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods), using QMK's
  [mod-tap functionality](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap)
