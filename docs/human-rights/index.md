# âš– Human Rights

All humans are equal. We all have the same rights.

I like to visit the [Canadian Museum for Human Rights](https://humanrights.ca/).
It's a reminder of what I am fortunate to have, what others in this world still
lack, how far we have come, and how far we have still to go. While I want to
believe that Canada is a good place to live regardless of who you are, this
museum is a reminder that we have done terrible things in the past. I am not at
fault for what occurred, but as a Canadian I am responsible for acknowledging
what occurred and making amends where I can.

- There was a time when it was illegal to teach a black person how to
  [read](reading/index.md), or for a black person to get a library card.
- Plantation owners used to hide their money in books because their slaves
  didn't know how to read, and therefore wouldn't pick up the books (need a
  citation for this).
