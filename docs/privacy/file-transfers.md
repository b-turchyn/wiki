# File Transfers

Some apps that can be used to securely transfer files between different
computers:

- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) - continuous file synchronization between
  devices, encrypted using TLS
- [Taildrop](https://tailscale.com/kb/1106/taildrop/) - share files between
  devices over a Wireguard network.
- [Enkra Send](https://send.enkra.io/)
  - [Source code for Enkra](https://github.com/enkra/enkra-send), written with
    [Flutter](/programming/frameworks/flutter.md) and Rust
- [Wormhole](https://wormhole.app/)
