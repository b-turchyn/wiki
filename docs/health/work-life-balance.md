# Work/Life Balance

Work/life balance involves ensuring you keep your work and personal lives
separate and your work life doesn't interfere with your personal life.

Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it's easy to have work bleed into your
personal life. We are increasingly in an always-on work environment, and if you
have an international team, 5pm doesn't mean that your whole team is offline for
the day.

## One-Time

- Set up quiet hours for email, instant messaging, or other systems you get
  notified from. Don't get notifications outside of working hours.
- Set your office hours in your email client, if it's supported. If not, you can
  put this information in your email signature or IM status.
  - My instant messaging status provides instructions on how to get in touch for
    production emergencies.

## Day-To-Day

- Plan your day. Dedicate time to the tasks you need to get done.
- Turn off your work computer after your day is over.

## Weekly

- Burnout check. How are you feeling? Is burnout setting in?

## Monthly

- Overtime. How often in the past month have you worked more than your
  regularly-scheduled amount? Is the total amount going down month-to-month?
- Time Off. When was the last time you took vacation? Do you have vacation
  scheduled? If not, schedule time off.
