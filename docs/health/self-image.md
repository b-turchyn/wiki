# Self-Image

Your self-image is how you see yourself. How you see yourself impacts how you behave, because you behave in alignment with how you see yourself (known as [[Inner Mirror]]).

By behaving in accordance with your [self-ideal](health/self-ideal.md), your self-image improves.

This is one of three parts of your personality, along-side [self-ideal](health/self-ideal.md) and [self-esteem](health/self-esteem.md).
