# The Brain

When we're using our brains, we have System 1 and System 2.

- _System 1_ is our fast-thinking, unconscious brain. It takes care of
  comfortable, familiar tasks, such as quickly reading some text or typing on a
  keyboard. The effort level is low, but this is due to having a pre-existing
  library of information to pull from (this is part of the reason why a
  [second brain](writing/second-brain.md) can be useful -- to give yourself more
  information to quickly pull from).
- _System 2_ is our slow-thinking, methodical brain. This takes significantly
  more effort and energy to use than System 1, but is where new thoughts can be
  processed and more complicated tasks can be performed. It is for this reason
  why [context-switching](productivity/context-switching.md) should be avoided,
  and [deliberate practice](productivity/deliberate-practice.md) encouraged.

## Amygdala

- Considered the "emotional centre" of the brain (from "Peak Performance").
- A study conducted out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison <sup>(which
  study?)</sup> compared brain activity in the Amygdala when exposed to stress.
  The study looked at those that were experts in meditation, and those that were
  not. The experts were able to acknowledge and then turn off the Amygdala's
  response (referred to as an _amygdala hijack_).
- This concept of turning off the Amygdala is used to help people "turn off"
  after a long day of focused work.
- While not covered in the study, similar behaviour has been seen in
  professional athletes.
