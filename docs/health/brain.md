# The Brain

## Amygdala

- Considered the "emotional centre" of the brain (from "Peak Performance").
- A study conducted out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison <sup>(which study?)</sup> compared brain activity in the Amygdala when exposed to stress. The study looked at those that were experts in meditation, and those that were not. The experts were able to acknowledge and then turn off the Amygdala's response (referred to as an _amygdala hijack_). 
- This concept of turning off the Amygdala is used to help people "turn off" after a long day of focused work. 
- While not covered in the study, similar behaviour has been seen in professional athletes.
