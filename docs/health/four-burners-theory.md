# Four Burners Theory

Your life is a stove with four burners on it. Each burner represents a different
area of your life:

- Family
- Friends
- Health
- Work

The stove can't run all burners at 100%; you must choose which burner doesn't
get as much gas.

The Four Burners Theory highlights a few points:

- There are always trade-offs in life. Saying "yes" to one thing means saying
  "no" to other things.
- In order to be successful in one area, you need to turn off or significantly
  reduce one other burner. To be really successful, you need to do this for two
  burners.

The origin of the Four Burners Theory is unclear.
