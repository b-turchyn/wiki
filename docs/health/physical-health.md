# Physical Health

Physical health is the result of ongoing maintenance and growth of your physical
self. In general, maintaining good health is a direct result of _what you put
in_. This includes:

1. Diet: not over-eating, consuming healthy foods, eating a balanced diet
2. Exercise: this is the constant tune-ups that you would do to your car, except
   this needs to be done much more frequently.
3. Sleep: perhaps the most important out of these. Without sufficient sleep,
   your body doesn't have the energy required to take care of their diet and
   exercise. It's also critical for [mental health](/health/mental-health).
