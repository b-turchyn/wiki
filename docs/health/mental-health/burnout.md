# Burnout

I have burned out [once in December 2019](https://brianturchyn.net/burnout/). It
is, to this date, one of the hardest experiences I've ever been through.

Interesting reads about personal experiences with burnout:

  - I found this article on
    [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35577285). The quote at
    the top of this article is from Audrey's article.

This video on the DW Documentary YouTube channel was a really interesting watch:
[Burnout - When does work start feeling pointless?](https://youtu.be/raVms8w61No)

- Someone in the documentary mentions that they were hoping to get hit by a
  vehicle on their way to work so that they didn't have to go anymore.
- Another person mentions the immense pressure they feel to be successful in
  their job, and that they feel ungrateful being in a well-paid position and
  complaining about it, knowing that other people have it worse.
