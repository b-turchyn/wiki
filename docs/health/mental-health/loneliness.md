# Loneliness

night, and when you can do whatever you want. What do you call it, freedom or
loneliness?"

A report[^1] published in February 2022 by Harvard suggests that a large number
of people experience "serious loneliness" (feeling lonely frequently or almost
all of the time) -- 36% of the roughly 950 participants in the surveys. Within
this, 61% of young adults felt seriously lonely.

Socialization was commonly found in a _third place_, but the Covid pandemic has
impacted people's ability to participate in a physical third place. Online third
places have replaced physical ones, however I suspect that interacting
exclusively in an online format that the social benefits are less pronounced
than if one were to meet in person.
