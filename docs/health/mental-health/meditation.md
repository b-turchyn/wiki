# Meditation

Meditation helps me practice keeping a single intention in my mind, which is something I struggle with with so much technology around me. My [attentional space](/psychology/attentional-space.md) grows after a session. 

Meditation seems to help me stay more focused and productive throughout the day. 

I use [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) for guided meditation practice.
