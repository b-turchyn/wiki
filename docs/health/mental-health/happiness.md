# Happiness

Being happy is an emotional state of no anxiety or fear[^1].

Happiness itself is not a goal; it is the result of making other
[choices](psychology/choice.md). Pursuing happiness directly will not result in
happiness, only sadness.

Happiness comes from:

- Maintaining good [physical health](health/physical-health.md)
- Maintaining good [mental health](/health/mental-health)

Your time-focus impacts your happiness. Focusing on the present allows you to
appreciate what you currently have and lets you enjoy life. Focusing on the
future allows you to plan for that future and ensure you spend your life doing
something that will leave you truly fulfilled.
