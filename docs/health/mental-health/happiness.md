# Happiness

Being happy is an emotional state of no anxiety or fear[^1].

Happiness itself is not a goal; it is the result of making other
[choices](psychology/choice.md). Pursuing happiness directly will not result in
happiness, only sadness.

Happiness comes from:
- Maintaining good [physical health](health/physical-health.md)
- Maintaining good [mental health](/health/mental-health)
