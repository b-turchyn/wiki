# Vitamin D

The main source of vitamin D is via UVB radiation; typically this is from the
sun, but less than 5% of sun is UVB.

[Sunlight](/health/sunlight.md) is a good source of vitamin D depends on the
time of year and where you are in the world.

There are several studies that suggest that vitamin D can help with depression,
however there seems to be significant criticism of those studies. A
meta-analysis of those studies[^1] seemed to see a correlation between the two,
but not enough to recommend vitamin D as a universal treatment.
