# Everything I Know

A collection of random notes.

My goal is for this to be my [digital garden](writing/digital-garden.md): a
curated collection of information that I find useful and beneficial to refer
back to. Maybe this information is useful to others.

I'm a big fan of learning in public. I will almost certainly make mistakes at
some point, and I will learn from others when they (hopefully) correct me. In
turn, I hope others read the information I've gathered here and get something
out of it.

Some articles you may find interesting:

- [My Workflow](workflow.md)

## Statistics

{@import ../loc.txt}

## Customizations

- Math equation support[^1] via
  [`remark-math`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/) and
  [`rehype-katex`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/blob/main/packages/rehype-katex)
- ~~Overriding header IDs to match Obsidian's auto-complete style
  ([source](https://github.com/b-turchyn/wiki/blob/main/src/plugins/section-prefix.js))~~
  Disabled for now since I use [Vim](devops/vim.md) for editing this instead of
  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Waiting for [GFM-style slugs to be
  supported](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/support-gfm-style-kebab-case-heading-slug-anchor-targets/30350)
- Smartypants support using
  [@silvenon/remark-smartypants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants)
- Local search using
  [easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local)
- [Additional syntax
  highlighting](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#supported-languages)
  added to theme configuration
