# Mastodon

Mastodon is one of the biggest decentralized microblogging platforms -- an
alternative to Twitter.

[I have an account at Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@btwritescode).

Mastodon-Twitter crossposter apps exist, but since
[Twitter](/social-media/twitter.md) is removing free access to the API, many of
these will no longer work.

## Web Clients

Mastodon has a built-in web client. There are native Android and iOS
applications as well.

[Elk](https://elk.zone) is a really promising web client that looks very nice.
Worth keeping an eye on.
