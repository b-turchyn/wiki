## Going Viral

The approach that Jenny Hoyos uses (based on Jay Clouse's October 11th 2023
newsletter)

1. Aim for 34 seconds long. Shorts shorter than 30 seconds required almost-100%
   retention to go viral.
2. She uses the formula of Hook, Foreshadowing, Narrative, Ending (with a twist)
3. She used language used at a 5th grade level, nothing too complicated

This seems like a fine paradigm for getting lots of views (and in turn, more ad
revenue), however the question is whether views should be the primary goal. I
suppose ad revenue is an important source of income for creators.
