# Open Graph

## Image Sizes

The Open Graph standards don't specify specific image sizes, and so unofficial
standards seem to have developed by social media sites and how they display
content.

Facebook recommends a 1.91:1 ratio with a minimum resolution of 1200 x 630, and
other social media sites seem to have roughly gravitated towards that same
standard.
