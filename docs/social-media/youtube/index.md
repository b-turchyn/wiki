## Growing a channel

_Most of this is based off of Ali Abdaal videos_

### Levels

Ali describes growth on YouTube in three levels:

- _Level 1_ is under 100 subscribers and under 20 videos. The goal here is to
  _get going_ and just start the process, building momentum.
- _Level 2_ is where you _get good_. This can be based on both your internal
  metrics (does it feel cringy to watch yourself?) and external metrics (are
  people watching or interacting with your content?).
- _Level 3_ is where you _get smart_.

Moving between levels 1 and 2, in addition to the metric counts, involves making
a decision about how committed you are to YouTube content creation. Is this
casual for you, or is it serious? If it's casual, then you are not interested in
actually growing. You might want to grow, but you're unwilling to put in the
effort to make that happen.

Moving between levels 2 and 3 involves making a decision about whether YouTube
is a hobby or a business. Is this for yourself, or to make value for others (and
make money)?

Ali suggests only deciding on a niche as you move between Level 2 and 3.

### Time Management

There are roughly five steps to creating a YouTube video:

1. Idea
2. Title/Thumbnail/Hook
3. Writing
4. Record
5. Edit

Editing often takes lots of time, and Ali recommends outsourcing this as soon as
possible. It frees up lots of time. Someone can often do this better for you,
and editing gets in the way of the rest of the content creation.

Writing is usually the second largest amount of time. For education content
creators, you can save lots of time by using bullet points and talking naturally
to the camera. Scripting can feel inauthentic, and since you're an expert on
what you're teaching, you can talk to it with prompts rather than an exact
script.

Educational videos should only really cover about three points per video,
otherwise viewers will get distracted. Another potential approach is to go to
really long-form content (i.e. Hbomberguy)

#### Fleshing Out An Idea

The _HIVEs_ method is a good starting point:

- Hook
- Intro
- Value
- End screen sales pitch

For educational content, the hook is often similar to the title of the video.

An intro is introducing yourself and provide some credibility. Why should they
spend their time watching your video? Prove your _social credibility_ (which
means you should probably get some social credibility if you don't have any!).

The social credibility can come from you not understanding how something worked
beforehand and now you do. It provides a way for viewers to relate to you.
