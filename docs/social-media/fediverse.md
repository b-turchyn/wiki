# Fediverse

## Reddit Alternatives

_For non-federated options, check
[Link Aggregators](/social-media/link-aggregators.md)_

- [kbin.social](https://kbin.social)
  - Fedi.Tips has
    [recommended this platform](https://mstdn.social/@feditips/110521303082388526)
- [squabbles.io](https://squabbles.io)
- [Tildes](https://tildes.net)
- [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/instances)
  - Note: [Fedi.Tips](https://mstdn.social/@feditips) has strongly recommended
    not using or supporting Lemmy due to [human rights](/human-rights/index.md)
    and oppression concerns. See
    [this thread](https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106835057054633379) for more
    information
  - I haven't checked to see if these are still valid concerns

## Twitter Alternatives

- [Mastodon](/social-media/mastodon.md) is one of the biggest options available.
  The software is stable and there are many instances available to use already.
  - The [official site](https://joinmastodon.org/) has lots of information about
    how it works and its key features
  - They provide a [list of servers](https://joinmastodon.org/servers) that you
    can join that have committed to adhere to the
    [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant). This
    commitment provides some guarantee of stability, active moderation against
    hate speech, and promote decentralization.
- [Wildebeest](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest)
  - This was built by Cloudflare for deployment on their platform.
  - Prepare to pay for this offering. As of 2023-06-12, their
    [Requirements](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest/blob/main/docs/requirements.md)
    docs suggest that the minimum monthly cost is about $10/month USD for an
    instance, which isn't too bad when shared with other people.

The following are not compatible with Mastodon's federation:

- [diaspora\*](https://diasporafoundation.org/)
  - I had used diaspora\* in the past, but it's a bit more of a walled garden.
    diaspora\* pods can federate, but they can't federate with Mastodon.
