# Streaming

The best guide I've read for doing a coding stream is by
[Suz Hinton](https://twitter.com/noopkat).
([Archive.org snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225001622/https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21),
since the original post is no longer available). The screenshots of OBS are old,
but much of the fundamentals still apply. Suz's earlier article about
[lessons learned from streaming on Twitch](https://web.archive.org/web/20190226221418/https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lessons-from-my-first-year-of-live-coding-on-twitch-41a32e2f41c1)
is a good read for those who are looking at getting into streaming.

## Streaming Sites

- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv)
- [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com)

## Streaming Tools

- [Mix It Up Streaming Bot](https://mixitupapp.com/) - originated from the
  now-defunct Mixer streaming platform. Run locally, tie into the Twitch API
  directly.
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) - The OG stream tool. Connects to all
  major streaming platforms. A must-use for any streamer.
- [NowPlaying](https://nowplaying.site/) - Browser source for streaming
  programs. Watches what you're currently playing in Spotify and shows a
  notification widget when the song changes.
  - [Royalty-Free Music](music/royalty-free-music.md) has a list of artists and
    songs that are safe to play while streaming.
- [StreamElements](https://streamelements.com/) - I use this for a chat bot and
  for overlays.

### Stream Automation

- [Aitum](https://aitum.tv)
- [Lumia Stream](https://lumiastream.com/)
- [SAMMI](https://sammi.solutions/), formerly
  [LioranBoard 2](https://github.com/LioranBoard/LioranBoard-2-Official/releases)

## Development Libraries

- [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) - Javascript library for the Twitch
  Messaging Interface
  - Version 1.x of this will stop functioning on February 18, 2023 for slash
    commands
    [per the developer announcement](https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/t/deprecation-of-chat-commands-through-irc/40486).

## OBS Plugins

- [Vertical](https://aitum.tv/#vertical) - Adds a vertical canvas to OBS
  along-side your regular horizontal one.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Aitum/obs-vertical-canvas/)

## Stream Assets

- [PixelPro](https://pixelpro.io/)
- [Visuals by Impulse](https://visualsbyimpulse.com/)
  - They have a bunch of semi-custom stuff available for generation on their
    site with no Photoshop/After Effects required. Neat.
- [Nerd or Die](https://nerdordie.com/)
  - I've bought two packs from them, and their support team is fairly
    responsive. Their pre-made packs don't always work great with Mac OS out of
    the box since the text boxes they use are on the Windows version of OBS
    Studio only.
  - There are lots of coupon codes available online for discounts on their
    products.
