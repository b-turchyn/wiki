# Business

Some interesting links:

- [Adstra](https://adstra.ai/), an AI-powered engine for helping people achieve
  their personal business goals.
  - I think I saw this on Hacker News at some point. Seems like a neat idea,
    although I'm not sure how much "artificial intelligence" is coming into play
    here.
- [Ask HN: What made your business take off that you wish you'd done much earlier?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30329762)
  - I stumbled across this question when it first came out. These are things I
    should really be thinking about as I build
    [CallToAr.ms](https://calltoar.ms).
  - SEO takes a long time to get going - work on it early (80/20 rule applies)
  - Don't be afraid to monetize your work
  - Marketing was the big takeaway
