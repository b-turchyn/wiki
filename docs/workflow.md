# My Workflow

My general process is:

- Input information into a low-friction input system
- Regularly review that information in a <abbr title="First In, First
  Out">FIFO</abbr> queue. Determine what I should be doing with that
  information.

## Input Systems

- I use Todoist for items that require action. _I_ have identified something
  needs to be done, so _I_ put it into Todoist. All entries start in the Inbox
  folder; anything in here must be sorted prior to being actioned.
- Email is used for action items requested from others. If I receive an email, I
  ultimately decide whether I will action it, and if so, it gets sorted
  appropriately.
- Items I want to read get put into Wallabag, usually via the Wallabagger
  extension in Firefox.

## Reviewing Input

Items in an input system get reviewed very regularly, ideally on a daily basis
but should be at least weekly. Todoist items, for example, should be daily, but
Wallabag reading can comfortably be weekly. I prioritize items first by the
[Eisenhower Matrix](productivity/eisenhower-matrix.md). I may not know what the
status is immediately, so if it hasn't been defined as urgent it can probably
sit a bit until I know more.

I then slot items that need to be actioned into an [Action
System](#action-systems).

## Action Systems

- For actions that must be performed on a particular date and time, I create
  calendar events. The description should contain all information required to
  action something, or at minimum a permalink to the required information.
  Depending on what it is, I can use Todoist for this as Todoist has an ICS URL
  to tie things into your calendar.
- For actions that can be performed at any time during a day, Todoist items with
  a deadline are used. 

## Reviewing Actions

What I need to do in a day should be reviewed in the morning after journaling
and at the end of my day. The morning review is for what I need to do today, and
the evening review is for what is coming up tomorrow in case there is anything
that needs to be actioned early in the morning. For example, a work meeting at
the beginning of my work day needs to be known about before I go to bed.

On a weekly basis, I review what's coming up for the week by looking at my
personal and work calendars, and the _Upcoming_ view on Todoist.

## Information Storage

Lots of input is knowledge that needs to be stored somewhere, either here or in
a private [Second Brain](writing/second-brain.md). The reading, understanding,
and storage of this knowledge is actioned by a task in Todoist with a permalink
to the source material.

Because I don't always remember why something's important, I try to put an
explanation about why the knowledge is important in the description.
