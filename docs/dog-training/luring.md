# Luring

Luring is a training technique that uses a food to direct a dog to perform an
action. One example of this is teaching your dog to lie down by holding a treat
in front of them and slowly lowering it to the ground as your dog lowers along
with it.

Luring should be used sparingly and phased out as soon as possible. This can be
done by using your hand to direct the action and then retrieving the food after
so that the hand is the trigger for the action.
