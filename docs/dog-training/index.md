# Dog Training

The general steps for training a new dog behaviour are:

1. Get the behaviour to occur by [capturing](/dog-training/capturing.md),
   [shaping](/dog-training/shaping.md), or [luring](/dog-training/luring.md).
2. Mark the behaviour with a clicker.
3. Reward the behaviour with something high value for the dog, such as treats,
   their favourite toy, or going outside.
4. Repeat until the dog does it easily at least 80% of the time.
5. Add a verbal cue just _before_ the dog does the action. This associates the
   action they're about to perform with the cue.
   - Adding the verbal cue before they are performing the action will associate
     "sit there and look at me" with the cue, rather than the action you want.
6. Use the verbal cue to get the requested action.

## Core Training

- Clicker "charging". Reinforce that the sound of a click means "treats"
- Name "charging". Reinforce that the dog's name means to look at the person
  calling the dog's name and await instructions.
- Sitting
- Lie down
- Puppy Push-Ups. Alternate between sitting and lying down.
- Stand
