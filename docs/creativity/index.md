## Being Creative

Creativity is a byproduct of trying to make something, not the other way around.
The best way to feel creative and to develop your creativity is to _be_
creative. Take action. Be disciplined and
[practice](/creativity/the-practice.md). Commit to sitting down and producing
something for five minutes. You are more likely to keep going once you get
started.
