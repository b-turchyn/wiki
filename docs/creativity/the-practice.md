# The Practice

The Practice is the process of consistently growing in your craft as a creative.
As a creative, the way to get better is to consistently _practice_ by doing.

The practice of creation is one that we should do because it's fun, fulfilling,
helps people, and provides you with a sense of accomplishment and purpose. We
should go through this practice regardless of external validation; we can't
control the number of likes or views something gets, but we can control us
producing on a regular basis to slowly get better at it.
