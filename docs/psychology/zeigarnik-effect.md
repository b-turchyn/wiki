# Zeigarnik Effect

The Zeigarnik Effect, named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist
[Bluma Zeigarnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluma_Zeigarnik "Bluma Zeigarnik")[^1],
is the tendency to keep unresolved problems front of mind. In other words, we're
more likely to remember incomplete things than complete things.

Chris Bailey brings this up in [Hyperfocus](/books/hyperfocus.md) as a tool that
we can use to improve what we focus on. By reducing the number of unresolved
items, we can focus on one thing better, putting ourselves into hyperfocus mode
easier. (See: [Attentional Space](/psychology/attentional-space.md))

To reduce the number of unresolved items, simply writing
[notes](/writing/notes.md) in a [notebook](/writing/notebooks.md) can be enough
to move things out of your mind.

Similarly, _deliberately leaving important items in an unfinished state_ can be
used to get your brain unconsciously processing the task at hand while you work
on other things.
