# Dating Tendencies

This is a framework created by [Logan Ury](https://www.loganury.com/), defined
in the book [How To Not Die Alone](https://www.loganury.com/book). The framework
roughly categorizes people into one of three groups based on what kinds of
unrealistic expectations that person may have when dating.

- _The Romanticizer_  has unrealistic expectations of relationships. Their
  expectations are similar to Disney fairy tales or a Hallmark Channel movie.
- _The Maximizer_ has unrealistic expectations of their (future?) partner. They
  are held to such a high standard that the Maximizer will never be satisfied. A
  Maximizer is always on the lookout for someone better.
- _The Hesitater_ has unrealistic expectations of themselves. They believe
  they're not ready to date, have flaws they need to fix first, etc.

A set of questions you can ask yourself to determine where you sit is available
in Chapter 2 of Logan's book or on [her website](https://www.loganury.com/quiz).

## The Romaniticizer

Romanticizers have a _soul mate mindset_ rather than a _work-it-out mindset_.
Their logic is that fate determines if and when they will find "the one"; in
other words, [love](psychology/love.md) is _beyond their control_. They likely
have specific requirements for traits in their future partner. When an obstacle
gets hit, a Romanticizer is more likely to just give up and move on rather than
talk it out.
