# Cohabitation Effect

Statistically, those who move in together before getting married are less likely
to be successful and satisfied with their marriage, and are more likely to take
part in extramarital affairs. An estimated 42% of couples who got married before
moving in together report being happy, versus 28% who moved in before getting
married.

More research seems to suggest that living together is the culprit; when you're
living together, it's harder to leave that relationship because you share
possessions in the house, a dog, and the ownership of the property. This seems
to be counteracted by ensuring you are moving in together for relationship
reasons (i.e. marriage or a life partnership of some sort), not for logistical
reasons (i.e. the rental contract is done at the end of next month).
