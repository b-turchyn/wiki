# Attachment Theory

Attachment theory is a theory that how we interact with a romantic partner is
related to how we interacted with our mother as an infant.

This was initially tested in a test known as the _Strange Situation_. A child
aged 12-18 months and their mother were put into a room and the child was given
time to get comfortable. The mother then left the room and the child's behaviour
was observed.

The original theory separated people into three categories: securely attached,
anxiously attached, and avoidantly attached.
