Tips to improve listening:

1. Get three minutes a day of silence (or the quietest you can find)
2. In a noisy environment, try to pick out how many distinct "channels" of sound
   you can hear.
3. Savour a mundane sound. Take something like a coffee maker or a fan and
   appreciate that sound for a while.
4. Adjust "listening positions". Move between active and passive, reductive and
   expansive, critical and empathetic.
5. RASA: Receive, Appreciate, Summarize, Ask. "Rasa" is the Sanskrit word for
   "juice" or "essence". Take in the information, offer a sign that you have
   taken in what someone else has said, summarize it in your own words, then
   follow up with something.
