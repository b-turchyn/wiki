# Toaster Fucker Problem

- Theory crafted by Hacker News user _tonfreed_.
- Before the internet, if somebody does something weird and they tell their friends, their friends berate them, goes to therapy, and comes out a bit better adjusted.
- In the age of the internet, the person instead goes online and finds a support group of others who think the same way they do, appearing to give credence to their belief.
