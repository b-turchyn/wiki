# Attentional Space

In [Hyperfocus](/books/hyperfocus.md), Chris Bailey notes that [meditation](/health/mental-health/meditation.md) can help grow your attentional space, allowing you to focus on more in one space. Personally I've found that my [hyperfocus sessions](/books/hyperfocus.md#hyperfocus-1) and my days are generally more focused and productive after meditating in the morning, however I don't have firm metrics to back this up.
