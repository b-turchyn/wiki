# Negativity Bias

Negativity Bias is the tendency to focus more on negative things rather than
positive things. Assuming two interactions of equal weight, one positive and one
negative, we tend to treat the negative interaction as more significant and will
dwell on it.

From an evolutionary standpoint, this was a key biological trait that allowed
humans to survive and avoid predators. In modern times, this tends to have less
use and can even negatively impact interactions with others, such as during
dating.
