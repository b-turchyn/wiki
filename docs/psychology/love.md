# Love

Love historically was not something that was factored into relationships and
[marriage](psychology/marriage.md). Love was considered illogical and
transitory, and since marriage was usually done for economic reasons, the two
didn't align.

Love and relationships, with a _work-it-out mindset_, take effort to maintain;
regular tune-ups are required, just like with your car. Having to work hard on
your relationship is a good sign, not a bad one.

Social media has a significant impact on one's perception of love. Movies and
romance novels may also impact, but it's implied that they're fake (even if
people forget that). Social media, on the other hand, appears real because
individuals are posting things. What is seen on social media is a curated,
edited, distorted view of what actually goes on in a healthy relationship.
