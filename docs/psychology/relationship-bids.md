# Relationship Bids

A relationship bid is an attempt to obtain affection and attention in our
relationships. The concept originated from John Gottman and Julie Schwartz
Gottman, who created the Gottman Institute.

Someone can respond in three different ways:

1. _Turning Toward_: Responding positively to the comment you made
2. _Turning Against_: Responding in a disagreeing way to the comment you made
3. _Turning Away_: Not responding to the comment you made, either by ignoring it
   or changing the subject.
