# Swedish Death Cleaning

Swedish Death Cleaning is when you get rid of the clutter in your life while
you're still able to, rather than leaving it for your next of kin when you pass
away.

By doing this, you not only lift a burden from your next of kin, but you also
ensure things get done the way you want them to.
