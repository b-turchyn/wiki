# Compliments

People are bad at both giving and receiving compliments.

When giving a good compliment, _specificity matters_. A general compliment feels
disingenuous or not that big of a deal. Specificity demonstrates that you've
observed something specific. Being specific means you've given the person an
area to continue to focus on and grow.
