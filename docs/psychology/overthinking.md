# Overthinking

Ruminating over a particular topic is generally unhealthy. You're better off
thinking about it once (such as when you're
[journaling](/writing/journaling.md), writing down your thoughts, then leaving
it be. There's little value to be gained by obsessing over something for too
long.

- Most of the time, nobody is thinking about you. You are not as important to
  others as you think you are. In all likelihood they're too busy thinking about
  themselves, just as you are thinking about yourself.
- It's impossible for you to know what someone else is thinking. Even if they
  tell you what they're thinking, you can't guarantee that they're telling you
  the truth, or even the whole truth. Because you can't know, you're better off
  assuming what they're thinking is good.
