  Japanese learning resources and my experiences trying to learn the language

# Japanese

I've always struggled with learning Japanese, but really love the language.

Free learning resources:

- [Japanese Like A Breeze](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/) has produced
  [Japanese Anki Decks](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/all-decks/); note
  that they require the jlab addon.
- [Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/) was
  recommended by the [Anki](/learning/anki.md) decks shared by Japanese Like A
  Breeze.
- [Comprehensible Japanese](https://cijapanese.com/) has lots of free content but
  also plenty of paid content. I've watched a few videos and the ones I watched
  were very good. (I found this from [this HN
  comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41743712), where the main article
  was talking about learning Mandarin while also working on their PhD).

Paid learning resources:

- I had used [TextFugu](http://www.textfugu.com) a long time ago. Registrations
  are currently closed (as of 2023-06-14).
  [EtoEto](https://twitter.com/EtoEtoApp) was supposed to be a replacement, but
  it seems that has stalled out and the domain is no longer available.
