# Celeste

Celeste is one of my favourite platformers I have ever played. The gameplay is
challenging without being impossible. The game motivates you to keep playing but
also encourages breaks. Failures are celebrated.

## Speedrunning

The game has first-party support for an in-game timer for speed running.

## Modding

Lots of mods have been created by the community. Olympus is a popular TAS and
mod launcher.
