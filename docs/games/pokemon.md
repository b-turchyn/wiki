# Pok√©mon

I first started playing Pokemon as a child when the Red and Blue versions came
out. I had fully beaten both, and almost fully completed the Yellow version. I
own a few other versions as well, but the original hold a special place for me.

## Mods, Randomizers, and More

- [Pokemon Infinite
  Fusion](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-infinite-fusion/) is a
  Windows-only fan creation that takes the concept of the [Pokemon Fusion
  Generator](https://pokemon.alexonsager.net) and brings it into the game by
  adding fusing of Pokemon as a core game mechanic. 
- The [Pokemon Coders](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/) has [a list of ROM
  hacks](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-rom-hacks/) made by fans.
- I have used the [Universal Pokemon Game
  Randomizer](https://pokehacks.dabomstew.com/randomizer/) to play
  [Nuzlocke](#nuzlockes) runs.

## Nuzlockes

In general, the rules for a Nuzlocke run are as follows:

1. You can only use a Pokemon if it is the first wild Pokemon you encounter on a
   route. For example, if you catch the first wild Pokemon you encounter when
   entering Route 21, you can use it. If you fail to catch it for whatever
   reason (it faints, runs away, etc) then you cannot catch another Pokemon in
   that area.
2. If a Pokemon faints, they are dead; you must release them or put them into
   storage.
3. While not required, you're encouraged to name each Pokemon you catch so its
   death hurts that much more.

This ruleset can be combined with a [Soul-Link](#soul-link) run.

## Soul-Link

Soul-link runs are played with two players on separate games. The rules of
[Nuzlockes](#nuzlockes) applies here; you can only use the first wild Pokemon
you encounter on a route. Both players must catch that Pokemon however. Once
this happens, the Pokemon are soul-linked. If one dies, the other also dies
(this is simulated by either releasing or storing that Pokemon).

I have used the [Pokemon Soul.Link](https://pokemon-soul.link/) software before,
but the author has deprecated it and encourages people to use
[PokeLink](https://discord.pokelink.xyz) (warning: Discord invite link). It is,
unfortunately, Windows-only, and is not, unfortunately, open source.

Some PokeLink resources:

- [Cysha/pokelink-web](https://github.com/Cysha/pokelink-web) contains different
  themes available as web sources for PokeLink.
