- What is a game?
  > "Games are a type of _play activity_, conducted in the context of a
  > _pretended reality_, in which the participant(s) try to achieve at least one
  > arbitrary, nontrivial _goal_ by acting in accordance with _rules_"

- _Play_ is an active form of entertainment rather than passive. Watching TV,
  YouTube, the theatre, or a concert is passive entertainment, but play involves
  active participation from you.
- Games are _pretending_ that the stakes matter, that the game environment is
  real for a moment.
- Games have a _goal_. Sometimes this definition seems to get stretched a bit
  (for example, with sandbox games like Minecraft or Eve Online), but there's
  generally something you're working towards
- When playing a game, you are bound by the _rules_ of that game.
