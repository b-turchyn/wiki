# Game Design

- What is a game?
  > "Games are a type of _play activity_, conducted in the context of a
  > _pretended reality_, in which the participant(s) try to achieve at least one
  > arbitrary, nontrivial _goal_ by acting in accordance with _rules_"
  >

  - _Play_ is an active form of entertainment rather than passive. Watching TV,
    YouTube, the theatre, or a concert is passive entertainment, but play
    involves active participation from you.
  - Games are _pretending_ that the stakes matter, that the game environment is
    real for a moment.

## Goals

Games have a _goal_. Adams[^2] separates goalless play from game play. Creative
or sandbox games such as Minecraft or Eve Online have the goal of creation.

Goals don't need to be achievable. You eventually die in _Pacman_ and _Space
Invaders_.

Adams defines three specific terms when talking about goals and end states:

- The _termination condition_ is when the game ends. For example, when the timer
  ends.
- The _victory condition_ is when a set of players has definitively won the
  game. Having the most points when the timer is up, for example.
- The _loss condition_ is the equivalent of the victory condition, except for
  losing the game. Running out of lives, for example.

## Rules

Rules define how the game is played, the [goal](#goals), and what is (or is not)
allowed.

When writing rules, it's important to be as clear as possible. Players need to
understand them and there can't be conflicts between the rules. If two different
players interpret the rules differently, then that breaks the game completely.

## Play

Game play involves a series of _challenges_ for a player to overcome, and a set
of _actions_ a player can perform to achieve those challenges. The challenges
don't need to be required to win the game (for example, side quests). As the
name implies, challenges should be _challenging_.
