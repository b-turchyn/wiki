# Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics

MDA is a "formal approach to game design and game research" created in 2004 by
Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek.
[This was documented in an academic paper](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf),
and is freely available via the Northwestern University website.

The approach breaks down game design into three sections:

1. Mechanics. Rules, systems. How the game actually works. These are what the
   game designers directly control. GMTK's video (see:
   [References](#references)) uses the example of the max ammo in a gun as an
   example.
2. Dynamics. How the player responds to those inputs. GMTK again uses the ammo
   capacity concept. More ammo gives you Doom Eternal or Diablo III. Less ammo
   gives you Resident Evil.
3. Aesthetics. How the player feels.

Each of these sections has a cascading effect. The rules impact how the player
acts, which impacts how the player feels.
