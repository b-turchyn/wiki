_B.R.E.A.D._ is an acronym for a drafting strategy.

## Bombs

Bomb cards, if unaddressed by your opponent, "go off" and will win you the game.

Look for:

- Big creatures, specifically ones that are hard to block
  - Flying, unblockable, indestructable, and trample abilities are examples of
    good evasion here.
- Significant [card advantage](/games/mtg/card-advantage.md)
- Game-breaking effects, such as big Planeswalkers

## Removal

Removal cards are ones that deal with your opponent's big threats. This can be:

- Counterspells
- Destroy or exile effects
- "Nerf" effects such as [Luminous Bonds](https://scryfall.com/card/grn/21/)
- Bounce spells
- Pump or fight spells
- Flash spells that allow you to block and kill during combat

## Evasion

Evasion cards give your creatures the ability to get past your opponent's
blockers. Flying, unblockable, and trample are good examples.

## Aggro

Aggro creatures are there to fill out your mana curve. They apply pressure to
your opponent so you can get out your bombs.

## Dirt

Dirt are the useless cards (for your deck).
