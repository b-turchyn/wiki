# Super NES Classic

## Loading Extra Games

1. On a Windows computer, install
   [Hakchi2](https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/Hakchi2-CE/releases)
2. Launch Hakchi. Allow access through the Windows firewall (failure to do so
   can cause problems with the kernel patching)
3. Install the custom kernel on the SNES Classic. In the menu, click `Kernel`
   --> `Install/Repair`. Follow the provided instructions.
    - If this goes awry, `Kernel --> Reset` seems to fix the kernel patching.
4. Once completed, click the `Add more games` button to add ROMs to the Hakchi
   library.
5. Click the `Synchronize selected games` button to sideload the ROMs to the
   device.
