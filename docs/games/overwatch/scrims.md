# Scrims

## Etiquette

* Don't critique in the middle of a game or match. Instead, save those comments
  for a game review afterwards, when the whole team can review the game from a
  macro level.
* Avoid directing swaps. If you have an idea of what might work better for
  another player, phrase it like "what do you think about &lt;hero&gt; here?". This
  allows you to get their perspective and leaves the decision fully in their
  hands.
