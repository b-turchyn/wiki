# Kiriko

## Strategy

- Swap the default left- and right-click abilities. Attack on left-click, heal
  on right-click.
- The default state is to do one left-click, one right-click in a battle. Change
  this up depending on how much you're in battle. Keep attacking during a
  teamfight which removes enemies from the fight.
