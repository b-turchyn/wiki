Interesting links:

- [Game of Life
  Lexicon](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon?ref=wiki.brianturchyn.net), a
  description of words used in Game of Life.
  - I found this really interesting to see what concepts people had come up with
    GoL.
- [Recursive Game of
  Life](https://oimo.io/works/life/?ref=wiki.brianturchyn.net)

  - What an interesting idea; the Game of Life is so complex and capable of so
    much; the fact that it can implement itself blows my mind.
