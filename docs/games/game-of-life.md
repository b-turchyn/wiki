Interesting links:

- [Game of Life Lexicon](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon), a description of
  words used in Game of Life.
  - I found this really interesting to see what concepts people had come up with
    GoL.
- [Recursive Game of Life](https://oimo.io/works/life/)

  - What an interesting idea; the Game of Life is so complex and capable of so
    much; the fact that it can implement itself blows my mind.
