## Variations

### Giuoco Piano

Translates roughly to "soft game" or "slow game", involves black playing
`3.Bc5`. A more open game can be initiated by playing `4.d4`, attacking the
newly-positioned black bishop.

### Giuoco Pianissimo

Translates roughly to "soft game" or "slow game", involves black playing `3.Bc5`
as above. This is either followed up with `4.d3` or `4.c3 Nf6 5.d3`

![r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5](https://www.chess.com/dynboard?fen=r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R%20b%20KQkq%20-%200%205&board=green&piece=neo&size=1)

### Evan's Gambit

Initiated by `4.b4`, challenging the black `c5` bishop to accept the gambit with
`4.Bxb4` or decline the gambit with `4.Bb6`.
