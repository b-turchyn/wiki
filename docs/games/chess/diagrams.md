# Chess Diagrams

## FEN Notation

## PGN Notation

PGN stands for **P**ortable **G**ame **N**otation and is a standard recording
format for chess games. PGN tracks individual moves, not just the current state
unlike [FEN Notation](#fen-notation).

## Image Generation

Chess.com can generate static images of gameplay as well as GIFs of movesets.
Static images use [FEN Notation](#fen-notation) and the GIFs accept either
[PGN Format](#pgn-notation) or a Chess.com link.
