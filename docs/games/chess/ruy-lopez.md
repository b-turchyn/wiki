# Ruy Lopez

The Ruy Lopez is a more aggressive opening than the
[Italian Game](games/chess/italian-game.md). This opening is more agressive
because `3. Bb5` applies pressure to `Nc6`, which in turn applies pressure to
the `e5` pawn (because `Nc6` is defending `e5`).

After this position, black's best move is to play `4. a6` to apply pressure to
white's bishop. This is known as the _Morphy Defense_.

After the opener, white can either play `4. Ba4` or `4. Bc4`.

- `4. Ba4` keeps applying pressure to `Nc6` as it originally intended to. This
  is known as the _Columbus Variation_.

- `4. Bc4` redirects that pressure back into the
  [Italian Game](games/chess/italian-game.md).

`4. Bxc6`, known as the _Exchange Variation_, is probably a bad idea. It
welcomes black to play `4. dxc6`. This will either invite black to play
`5. Bg4`, or if white plays `5. Nxe5`, black then plays `5. Qd4`. White is
guaranteed to lose some material here if black chooses to do so.
